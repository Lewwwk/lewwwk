A couple of weeks ago, [Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/) had a epiphany that ['hashtags are dead...'](http://beta.friendfeed.com/scobleizer/bb5b11fd/i-just-realized-hash-tags-are-dead-er-less). That epiphany was really more about realtime search than the future of hashtags. If anything, inline tags (hashtags) are going to be an increasingly important aspect of the [realtime web](http://lewwwk.com/post412).

Inline tags are simply the combination of a unique character and a keyword (e.g. #tag).  Introduced to [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"} by [Chris Messina](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-messina "Chris Messina"){.zem_slink rel="crunchbase"} back in 2007, hashtags have seen increasing usage around current events, conversation and collaboration. Here's what makes them uniquely valuable, particularly in the public micro-message:

- **Natural, fast, easy\**
  *Requiring only an additional keystroke they become part of natural practice, do not require additional action after typing and are not dependent on the medium.*
- **Explicit\**
  *Effectively reorients the rest of the message as context around that keyword, and enables explicit, permission-less participation in a public thread.*
- ****Threading\****
  *Tags link messages together in topical threads which allow for asynchronous public conversation. These threads are automatically related to contributors, other threads, and links with the message text forming a tight contextual wrapper around the thread  itself.*
- **Universal\**
  *Being text based, they can be used anywhere you type*

Hashtags are just the beginning of in-line tagging in public micro-messages. They will enable explicit threading and permissionless participation in the realtime web in a natural and extensible way. Chris Messina's [original post](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/) had some great details, some of which which I believe will be part of the core infrastructure of the realtime web. And as public micro-messaging services proliferate, inline tags will help enable cross-platform threading with the potential to weave the web and even our offline data.
