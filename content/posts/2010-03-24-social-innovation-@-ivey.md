Quick post to share today's presentations for [Social Innovation @ Ivey](http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/centres/building/outreach/).

First is my opening intro, which pulls from a core theme but adds a little more about my history and the levels, forms, and tools of social entrepreneurship -- or my best simplification of them.

The second, is a for a last minute stand-in role on the social finance workshop. Thankfully the wise and gracious [Karim Harji](http://www.socialcapitalpartners.com/about-us/team#karim) of [SocialFinance.ca](http://socialfinance.ca) shared this great, detailed deck.

As always, I'm looking forward to talking with students and trying to inspire them to go do out and do some good.
