Hey there,
:::

Sorry about the hangover.

It was a great party.  Never thought it would end.

Left a couple bucks on the table. Hope that covers the booze.

Oh, and I think the freezer thawed and someone puked in the well.  Might want to double-check before you cook up those last burgers or take a drink.

Also noticed there seems to be something wrong with the air conditioner. Think some of us were using it as an ashtray last night and it started making some weird sounds. Anyway, might want to take a look at that too. Heard it's going to get hot today.

We had a great time. Sorry it didn't turn out that way for you. Looks like flaw in the model.

Better luck next time!
