**It's go time.**

ChangeMedium Toronto is slated for October 24th at [MaRS](http://www.marsdd.com/MaRS-Centre.html). *What is it?* Read more to find out. *Want a hand in it?* Leave a comment below.

***What?*\
ChangeMedium** is an initiative to provoke public micro-messaging as a medium for change. Public micro-messaging (e.g. [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"}) is emerging as [the most accessible, participatory public medium in history](http://lewwwk.com/post436). Bringing the open and emergent properties of the web to the global reach of text messaging is already showing great potential for public benefit. But we've only begun to understand what's happening let alone build an infrastructure to make the most of this medium. Enter ChangeMedium Toronto.

**ChangeMedium Toronto** is an event to explore the frontiers, gather community, and make the medium. It will be a simple format with 2 tracks -- one for researchers and one for hackers. We want to explore the frontiers. What is this medium about? We want to push ourselves further. What are the implications for change? We want to contribute to making it better. Let's make it happen.

***Why?***\
The pace of change is stunning. [Researchers, hackers and makers are already involved in understanding and applying this medium](http://lewwwk.com/post436). Whether for fun, profit, or benefit we're creating this as we go. ChangeMedium Toronto is our inaugural effort to convene this community and introduce and provoke the potential for change.

***Who?***\
ChangeMedium emerged out of the work of a group of people passionate about the world play with Twitter as a platform for change. The Toronto event itself was provoked by [Frances Westley](http://sig.uwaterloo.ca/catalysts.html) and [Renjie Bitauld](http://sig.uwaterloo.ca/sig_staff.html) of [SiG@Waterloo](http://sig.uwaterloo.ca/), [Lisa Torjman](http://www.marsdd.com/About-MaRS/MaRS-Leadership-Team/torjman-l.html) and [Allyson Hewitt](http://www.marsdd.com/About-MaRS/MaRS-Leadership-Team/hewitt-a.html) of [SiG@MaRS](http://www.marsdd.com/Events/Event-Calendar/sig-info-session-02202009.html), [Ryan Coleman](http://ryancoleman.ca/), [Peter Flaschner](http://peterflaschner.com/), and [James Walker](http://walkah.net).

Of course we're just beginning and what ends up will be a product of the community. Have an idea? Want to play a role? Want to know more? Leave a comment and get the ball rolling.
