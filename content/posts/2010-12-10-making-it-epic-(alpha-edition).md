> "If you're not embarrassed when you ship your first version you waited too long." \~ [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/)

On Tuesday evening, [James](http://walkah.net), [Alan](http://twitter.com/thinksmith), and I linked arms, cringed a bit, and hit send. The first batch of invites to the [Epic.io](http://epic.io) private alpha were out.

Already we're learning a lot. As 'embarrassing' as some of the things we see are, what we're gaining from real-world usage is worth it. Feedback has been real and is helping us prioritize what needs attention most.

At the same time, the gulf between what we are tackling and what we are showing is huge. The messaging of Epic.io is, well, pretty [epic](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epic). It's big and bold and ambitious. It's risky too. Is it setting the expectations too high? Does it create too much dissonance between the promise and the user experience? Maybe.

But I'd rather be bold and be out there. Vulnerable in our ambition. Inviting in our mission.

Purpose is at the heart of all initiative, organization, and systems. If we succeed in making purpose the platform we  succeed in making that reality actionable and useful to people every day. And that should bring less noise, more meaning, and ultimately, fulfilment of what matters to each of us in our work and in our lives.

Life is too short for bullshit. We don't know where this will go, but we do know why we're doing it. So if that resonates why not [signup](http://epic.io/#), see what it means for you, and [tell us](http://feedback.epic.io) how it can make purpose the platform.

Let's [make it epic](http://epic.io)!
