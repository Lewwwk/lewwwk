I've [written some before](http://lewwwk.com/post350) on our efforts to peer-produce [Shouldess Inc.](http://shldlss.com) ([\^shldlss](http://ventwits.com/ventures/%5Eshldlss)), the developer of [VenTwits](http://VenTwits.com) and the for-profit cohort of the [Social Venture Commons](http://svcommons.com) ([\^svc](http://ventwits.com/ventures/%5Esvc)). We've decided to launch early and iterate rapidly with VenTwits and its group focused cousin GroupTwits (to be turned on soon). We're also planning to [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Open source"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} our code once we've rebuilt a core based on how people actually use it.

I believe in the principles and power of [peer-production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production "Commons-based peer production"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} but am finding it a constant tension as we build the for-profit startup. A big part of that I'm sure is my experiential conditioning. What's been most recently tested is how much of our business strategy and development plans should be in the [public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain "Public domain"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"}.

[Taylor Davidson](http://unstructuredventures.com), who is stepping up to help on the financial modeling and strategy side asked me point blank. I fumbled some lame answer that didn't really say anything. As I've sat with it now for a couple of days, I'm actually questioning what if anything should be kept private. It comes down to speed of execution and I also think that the more broader the engagement the greater defensibility we have -- provided we execute. If people are a part of it, they'll rally to support it.

What do you think? Is there anything that should be kept private? Why? What are the risks? What are the benefits?

Right now I'm feeling ready to open everything up and push this experiment even further.

Foolish or fruiful?
