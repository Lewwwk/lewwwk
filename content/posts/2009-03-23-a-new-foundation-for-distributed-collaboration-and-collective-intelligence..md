It's been an exciting year in the development of [the Social Venture Commons](http://svcommons.com) and [Shouldless Inc.](http://shldlss.com) We've learned a lot and believe what we contributing to the emergence of [public micro-messages as a new foundation for distributed collaboration](http://lewwwk.com/post355) and collective intelligence.

Twitter has been experiencing [extraordinary growth](http://mashable.com/2009/03/16/twitter-growth-rate-versus-facebook/) and the the use of #hashtags has enabled a new dimension. As we tag, we build threads. These threads weave throughout the Twittersphere, linking interests, communities and conversations. As we tag we're collectively weaving a tapestry that both describes our world and crafts the edges of what creates it. Over time I'm fascinated by the potential reach threads can have and see them as a launch-pad for new collaborations. And as these things happen, I can only imagine what these threads will be able to tell us about our selves and where the world is going. Only time will tell.

For those who have followed this blog and our exploration of this concept and the way we can peer-produce organizations it may have looked messy.  In a way it was. It's also been incredibly efficient.  Putting everything out there has attracted great feedback and new collaborators and has resulted in the launch of our core platform [thread.io](http://thread.io).

My hope is that this is just the beginning. Everything in me says we're on to something. What matters though is what you think and what your experiences tell you. We hope you [give it a try](http://thread.io) and [let us know what you think](http://feedback.thread.io).
