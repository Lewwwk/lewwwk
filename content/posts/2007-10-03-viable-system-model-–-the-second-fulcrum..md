The second fulcrum in [transformative]{#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-error} venturing is the way in which the venture is organized/organizes itself. I've recently been introduced into something that has come closest to describing what it means to build a successful organization. And it's not about outcomes or results -- those are simply that, outcomes -- it's about the way in which it's done.

> ([Stafford Beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital)'s) [Viable Systems Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_System_Model), or [VSM]{#SPELLING_ERROR_1 .blsp-spelling-error} is a [model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_%28abstract%29 "Model (abstract)") of the organisational structure of any viable or [autonomous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous "Autonomous") [system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"). A viable system is any system organised in such a way as to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The [VSM]{#SPELLING_ERROR_2 .blsp-spelling-error} expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted cybernetic description that is applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.

I also have the good fortune of being able to apply this model on a deeply [transformative]{#SPELLING_ERROR_3 .blsp-spelling-error} initiative with someone who has intimately been involved with application of the viable systems model for a couple of decades. The deeper I get into it the more it rings true --- which shouldn't be [surprising]{#SPELLING_ERROR_4 .blsp-spelling-corrected} considering it is 'simply' based on looking at how all life organizes itself in viable systems. Next time you're faced with some organizational challenges or considering building a venture to tackle something deeply important, do everyone a favour and spend some time with this model and/or people who understand it.

Next post -- venturing forward.
