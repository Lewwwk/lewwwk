:::: entry-content
I'm eager to get building and am hiring a developer. Think you might know anyone -- please help spread the word.

Here's the posting:

> We are a team of social and tech sector entrepreneurs.\
> We're launching a startup that builds apps for a better future, sooner.\
> We're looking for a full-time Ruby on Rails developer with the chops to help make it happen.
>
> What our RoR developer will do.\
> -- work with us to build solid, scalable apps, that people love using,\
> -- code brilliantly producing code that's clean, elegant, and efficient,\
> -- figure it out and get it done.
>
> What we expect our RoR developer will bring:\
> -- proven skills and expertise in RoR, real-time, social, web-based app development,\
> -- a community of peeps they ask and help in solving problems,\
> -- a history of building and being awesome.
>
> What we think you would love about working with us:\
> -- we do this to have fun, live well, and make the world better,\
> -- we're in this for the long haul, building stuff that sticks not fluff that fails,\
> -- we know what we're doing, have history that proves it, and we own our own bullshit.
>
> Sound interesting? Think this might be you? Tell us why by sending us an [email](mailto:dev@igniter.com). We'll respond to those who show they'll bring what we need and have told us tell us why they're interested.
>

>
> Deadline: Tuesday March 23rd, high noon.
