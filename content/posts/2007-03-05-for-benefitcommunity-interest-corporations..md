The U.K. and soon the U.S. are putting together some great new hybrid models that look to engage the power of the capital markets in ventures that are created strictly in community interest. Take a look [here](http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/Page.aspx?SP=1626) for a primer on the U.K. model and [here](http://www.xigi.net/2007/02/22/mixing-mission-and-business-new-legal-forms-for-social-enterprise.html) for launch pad to some of the U.S. work. Seeing the evolution of markets is a wonderful thing.
