A brief twitter conversation with Tom at [www.givemeaning.com](http://www.givemeaning.com) on this subject had me feeling limited by the 140 character twitter limit... so here goes a quick mobile post.

I\'ve been conscious of the impact and role of consumption in our society for a while but [www.storyofstuff.com](http://www.storyofstuff.com) and the movie Manufactured Landscapes from Mongrel Media have had me thinking a bit deeper lately.

I think \'giving\' has largely becoming another form of buying. Certainly giving has very little to do with need -- unless ofcourse you turn to things like [www.givemeaning.com](http://www.givemeaning.com) :-). And the concept of enough is an abstract thing that is a personal, individual assessment of their own fulfillment of wants. And wants are fueled by cosumption. The more people shop and buy, the more they are exposed to things they could have and so are encouraged to have new wants. Green consumerism fits right into that. I\'m all for efficiency and recycling but those shouldn\'t encourage further consumption beyond replacement of what is no longer working.

I\'ve started asking myself the following everytime I spend money.\
\
-- need?\
\
-- want?\
\
-- enough yet?

It\'s interesting, and, if you want some help giving it a try, send me an email at michael \<at\> igniter \<dot\> com and for \$25 I\'ll send you a set of stickers to put on everything you use to make a purchase. Might be the best thing you could do to save the world 🙂

Seriously. If I get 100 requests, I\'ll put up a website about for those who are conquering consumption one question at a time. Fun.\

... while mobile.
