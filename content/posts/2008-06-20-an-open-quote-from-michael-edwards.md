## [Open: "more radical innovations in ownership and production that change the basis on which markets currently work"](http://igniter.tumblr.com/post/39078854/open-more-radical-innovations-in-ownership-and)

In the conclusion of ["Just Another Emperor"](http://justanotheremperor.org) by Michael Edwards, he poses the above quote which I think is a great description of what 'open' is actually playing at. Full context here: "Philanthrocapitalism offers one way of increasing the social value of the market, but there are other routes that could offer equal or better results in changing the way the economic surplus is produced, distributed and used: the traditional route that uses external pressure, taxation and regulation; the philanthrocapitalist route that changes internal incentives and gives a little more back through foundations and corporate social repsonsibility; and the more radical innovations in ownership and production that change the basis in which markets work. We don't know which of these routes carries the greatest long term potential, though all of them rely on civil society as a vehicle for innovation, accountability, influence and modified consumption, and especially for getting us from reformist to transformational solutions."
