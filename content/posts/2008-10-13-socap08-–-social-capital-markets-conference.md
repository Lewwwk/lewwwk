I'm getting ready to head to [SoCap08](http://socialcapitalmarkets.net) in [San Francisco](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7793,-122.4192&spn=0.1,0.1&q=37.7793,-122.4192%20%28San%20Francisco%2C%20California%29&t=h "San Francisco, California"){.zem_slink rel="geolocation"}. Here's a brief blurb on what it's about -- and for those of you who are interested there is a twitter [account](http://twitter.com/socap08) and [tag](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23socap08) that you can follow.

> **Doing well and doing good** is the mantra of a new generation of entrepreneurs and the organizations that invest in them. And Social Capital Markets 2008 (SoCap08) is a new event designed to bring together all of the people and organizations with a similar deep passion to change the world through sustainable businesses.
>
> We're at the cusp of a massive sea-change in the ways that businesses can impact global and local problems. In the past, startup profit-motivated businesses were funded by risk capital, and socially-focused organizations were supported by philanthropy. The profit-oriented were rarely allowed to let a social mission intrude, and the socially-oriented were discouraged from building sustainable businesses. But a new breed of entrepreneurs -- and a new mentality of those who fund them -- is changing the landscape of business, investing and philanthropy.
