That's right, [Social Tech Training](http://www.marsdd.com/socialtechtraining) is happening this June in Toronto. Here's the link and a quick blurb. Check-it out and sign-up if it catches your eye. Coming from [Web of Change](http://www.webofchange.com) and [MaRS](http://www.marsdd.com/) it's bound to be an excellent event!

> No one working in social change these days can afford to ignore the opportunities offered by the web. Most organizations get stuck, though, on "How do we do it?" "Where do we start?" and "Who can help us?" Interest in high, but the talent pool of people equipped to understand, prioritize, and implement these tools and ideas remains limited.
>
> We've gathered the best and the brightest leaders in this sector, and we've put together an [agenda](http://www.marsdd.com/socialtechtraining/agenda.html) that will help take your organization to the next level. Each participant will emerge with new technical, creative, and leadership skills, a powerful network, and a customized, comprehensive "Web 2.0 Plan" for their organization.
>
> This training is an excellent opportunity to connect to the big picture, develop practical skills required to execute, and network with both leaders and learners in this emerging space. We are excited to be part of this transformation of the social change sector. [Please join us!](http://www.marsdd.com/mars/socialtechtraining/registration.html)
