Building on my [previous posts](http://lewwwk.com/tag/social-venture-commons) about the Social Venture Commons here's a draft overview of what's been brewing. This venture is one part of my trio to support the ventures working from the [new mode of organizing](http://lewwwk.com/?s=organizing+mode) I see emerging. The two other pieces are the [micro-funds](http://lewwwk.com/post320) [(presentation coming soon)]{style="text-decoration: line-through;"} which is a modified version of early-stage venture/angel investing and a [social capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital "Social capital") learning project (in development for a trio of venture networks) based in part on [the thinking here](http://lewwwk.com/post277).

[Ping me directly](http://lewwwk.com/about) if you are interested in learning more -- and if you have comments on the presentation below please add them to this post.
