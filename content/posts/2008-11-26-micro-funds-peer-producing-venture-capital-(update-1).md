Here's my first crack at the Micro-Funds concept.  It's related to the [Social Venture Commons](http://lewwwk.com/post339) and [Social Capital](http://lewwwk.com/post277) work I've been developing. They are all based on the [new mode of organizing](../?s=organizing+mode) I see emerging.
**
\*\*\* I've also added an illustration of 3 alternative models that have emerged in recent conversations. They are all interesting in their own right and it may be more about using them in according to specific situations. All comments/suggestions/alternatives welcome. \*\*\***
