So this is what it comes down to:

I'm exploring:\
-- ways to accelerate the individual capacity for positive change\
-- ways to systematically, repeatably, apply the [entrepreneurial]{#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-corrected} approach toward environmental and social justice

The principles I'm working from:\
-- The community holds the knowledge and experience.\
-- We facilitate their wisdom\
-- We orchestrate their solution

So... if anyone has anything that maybe relevant (connections, docs, [initiatives]{#SPELLING_ERROR_1 .blsp-spelling-corrected}, etc.) to either of those areas that I'm exploring, I'd love to hear about them!
