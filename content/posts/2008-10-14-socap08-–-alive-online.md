:::

First the physical event. There are over 600 participants from the usual people but also from more mainstream financial players that are seriously starting to get their toes wet. I first heard about this a year ago when Kevin Jones of [GoodCapital](http://goodcap.net) was just starting to pull it together and I must say they did an extraordinary job of convening the community in a big way.

Now for the virtualization. In addition to some on-site use of social networking tools which I've yet to try there is a [twitter account](http://twitter.com/socap08) and [tag](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23SoCap08) and [live blogging stream](http://socialcapitalmarkets.net/blog).  I've put the feed streams of each below. They are great resources for getting a feel for what is happening during the session. It also is a great jumping point to explore who else is in this community and what they are doing and thinking. What maybe I find most interesting is that even though I'm at the event, I'm getting as much out of the twitter stream as I am from the sessions I'm actually attending. A much richer experience that's helping me get a bigger picture than I would be able to otherwise.

Take a look and let me know what you think -- if you aren't here in person are these two stream helpful? Informative? Fun? Why/How?
