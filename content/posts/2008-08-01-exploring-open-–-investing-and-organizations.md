Well the [OpenEverything Retreat](http://openeverything.wik.is/Retreat_wiki) turned out to be great event with over 30 participants and some great output. The [Investing in Open Session](http://openeverything.wik.is/Retreat_wiki/Agenda/Investing_in_Open) brought together Helen King from the [Shuttleworth Foundation](http://shuttleworthfoundation.org){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}, Joel Solomon from [Renewal Partners](http://www.renewalpartners.com), and Paul Biondich from [OpenMRS](http://www.openmrs.org){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. For the highlights check out the [notes from the session](http://openeverything.wik.is/Retreat_wiki/Agenda/Investing_in_Open){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} and for those who want to dig a little deeper and contribute to the conversation there's now a [open exploration on Investing and Open](http://openeverything.wik.is/Mapping_Open/Explorations/Investing_and_Open) in the [Mapping Open](http://openeverything.wik.is/Mapping_Open) section of the [OpenEverything wiki](http://openeverything.wik.is/).

Dive in and help shape this space.

[[The OpenEverything retreat](http://openeverything.wik.is/Retreat_wiki) is coming up and in prep I've setup a [wiki](http://sites.google.com/a/igniter.com/open-explorations/) to begin exploring attributes and examples of Open Organizations and practices for/what's different with Investing in Open.]{style="text-decoration: line-through;"}
