I was just writing an update to some great partners of mine and realized I needed to include a recap of 2009 for some context on what's next. That of course reminded me that I'd yet to post one. So here goes.

2009 was a pivotal one for me -- a year of transition. It was full of new adventures and an unexpected closure of [an old one](http://cleanenergydevelopments.com/). 2009 started with a bunch of excitement and energy around the [Social Venture Commons](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/the-social-venture-commons-1130928), [VenTwits](http://lewwwk.com/post371), and [Thread.io](http://lewwwk.com/post406). A group of us had come together and were sweating out an experiment in peer-producing some apps that we thought could help people come together and build a better world by using [public micro-messaging](http://lewwwk.com/post355). We had some encouraging feedback on the concepts but we missed the mark and didn't get enough traction (users or funding). We had felt we were constantly 2 weeks ahead of 'everyone else' and when we took stock of what we felt we'd need to get to a [viable venture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_System_Model), we just couldn't do it with what we had. I had failed at guiding us through to a [viable product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and estimating what it would take to get us there.

At the same time, my [past life](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/michaellewkowitz) in energy and finance rose up and I became engaged in designing a financing framework around what the [Green Energy Act Alliance](http://greenenergyact.ca/) hoped would make Ontario North America's leading jurisdiction for renewable energy ([it did](http://tumblog.igniter.com/post/367010034/al-gore-has-called-the-green-energy-act-the)) and particularly [community power](http://www.ontario-sea.org/Page.asp?PageID=751&SiteNodeID=202). [The Act](http://www.greenenergyact.ca/Page.asp?PageID=1224&SiteNodeID=202&BL_ExpandID=44) was tabled in May which then prompted another engagement to help the [CPFund](http://www.cpfund.ca/) plan for a transition to the new reality. That plan, if successful, stands to be a great example of [social finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_finance) and turn the renewable energy finance sector on it's head.

Closing out the summer, my social finance sojourn continued with the opportunity to co-lead a [Canadian contingent](http://www.socialfinance.ca/blog/post/canadians_at_socap09/) to the [Social Capital Markets](http://www.socialcapitalmarkets.net/) conference. Next came the privilege of doing a review of [Vartana](http://vartana.org) -- an ambitious project that aimed to change the way the charitable sector banked in Canada. And then things shifted.

On my birthday I learned that a company I founded was in discussions on being acquired. Those talks [came to fruition](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/keyDevelopments?rpc=66&symbol=NRG.TO&timestamp=20091005130000) in early October, and while not a big exit by many standards, for [our](http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaellewkowitz/4096824703/in/set-72157622662336785) lean life it was/is a big turning point. It meant taking a breath and taking stock. It meant getting 'our house in order'. It meant saying thank-you to those who've supported me.

An adventurous chapter with an unexpected plot twist was over. Thankfully it's part of a book that I love... one of those books I just can't put down.
