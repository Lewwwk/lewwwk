I'm scheduled to open the [Social Innovation @ Ivey Form](http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/centres/building/outreach/) and have been asked to get the audience of students 'fired up' about [social entrepreneurship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship "Social entrepreneurship") and innovation. What would you tell them?

They are currently deciding on which electives to take and of course what career path to take -- a big part of why I love doing these talks. I've been asked to tell my story, touch on social entrepreneurship and social finance and have 30 minutes to do it.

Earlier this year I gave the presentation below. It generated some good feedback but I felt like it missed the mark. Any suggestions appreciated. How would you get them moving toward #socent?
