I wrote about the gist of this image [here](http://lewwwk.com2008/02/venturing-on-frontiers-simple-guide.html). Now I'm turning to the implications for venturers.

Quite simply the essence of venturing is a process. A process of creating spaces for things to happen (some call it 'luck'). The simpler and more accessible the space, the easier it is to get people engaged and get things done (some would say 'the luckier you get').

Sound simple? It should be, but can you simply articulate the 3 primary spaces for your venture? Do you have a time and place to think about and evolve those spaces? Why are people connecting to you? Do they know what they need to meaningfully contribute in ways you may not have asked or may not be expecting? How often have you been 'lucky'?

So how can ventures get better at "gettin' lucky" on the frontiers?

[Step 1: Define your spaces ([framing]{style="font-style: italic;"})]{style="font-weight: bold;"}
Get out you favourite notebook or stash of napkins and start framing each of your primary spaces separately: founding agreement, magic box; and realms of relevance. Keep them separate. Keep them simple. [(more on this in a later post)]{style="font-style: italic;"}

[Step 2: Get your team together and get to it ([planning]{style="font-style: italic;"})]{style="font-weight: bold;"}
Revisit planning as a team -- those who control the resources and those who do the work. In the context of your spaces, figure out what your going to do for the next meaningful chunk of time, making the most of what you have, and getting what you need to move you most towards fullfilling your purpose.

[Step 3: Connect with purpose ([connecting]{style="font-style: italic;"})]{style="font-weight: bold;"}
Make connections throughout your spaces to better understand and define your spaces, and to get done what you need to get done. Do it with purpose and give it space to let something happen.

[Step 4: Repeat ([venturing]{style="font-style: italic;"})]{style="font-weight: bold;"}
Take a look at what you did for steps 1-3 and do it again -- but better. This becomes the process of venturing. Find what works for you and your venture. There is no right way. There is no right answer. In fact, there really are no answers... just keep asking questions, keep moving forward, and keep at the process.

You can't know where exactly you'll end up but you've got a much better chance of "gettin' lucky"!
