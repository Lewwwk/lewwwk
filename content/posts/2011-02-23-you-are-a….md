I recently tweeted the question: "What term to you prefer. 'user', 'person', something else."

I received some pretty polarized responses:

I'm torn myself. Not entirely comfortable with 'user' but I haven't come across any options I like better. 'Participant' is interesting, but somehow still undervaluing.

What do you think? Any better suggestions or examples?
