::: entry-content
I've done my quick first draft on exploring the entrepreneurial approach and its application. You can find it [here](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/igniter-venture-buliding-approach-impact-focused-accelerated-deliberate-replicable/). I wasn't going to post it yet, but just had a great conversation with a coffee friend ([here](http://www.merchantsofgreencoffee.com), [here](http://www.freshcoffeenetwork.com), and [here](http://www.globalwarmingcoffee.com)) that was prompted by this draft. Cheers to good conversations!
