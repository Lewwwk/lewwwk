[![](/images/ventwits-puagku.jpg)](/images/ventwits-puagku.jpg)[VenTwits](http://ventwits.com) is about people building the things they care about. It came from seeing the potential in [Twitter](http://twitter.com) as a medium for discovery, connection, and practical engagement. With VenTwits we hope it can help you find new ventures you are interested, give you an opportunity to participate, and simply help things happen.

To get started, simply [login to VenTwits](http://ventwits.com) once using your Twitter user name and password. If you aren't on twitter there is a link right there where you can sign-up quickly and easily. Once you've logged in for the first time, [VenTwits](http://twitter.com/ventwitsapp) knows to follow you and look for anything you tweet that uses a VenTwits tag. From that point on, you can tweet through the site, through Twitter, or whichever way you twitter best.

Tagging is simple. In any tweet you post, simply add a '\^' in front of a venture name.  For example: [\^VenTwits](http://ventwits.com/ventures/%5Eventwits).  In addition to showing up in your regular twitter stream, that tweet will now show up on VenTwits as well.  You can also add another level of tag that allows for conversations to happen around a venture.  For example: [\^VenTwits !feedback](http://ventwits.com/ventures/%5Eventwits/needs/!feedback) shows up as a conversation around VenTwits feedback.

That's it. You're all set.

Now, the best way to get started is to simply explore.  Visit [http://VenTwits.com](http://ventwits.com) and click on the links that you find interesting. Explore a new venture, jump into a thread, or see what the top contributors are talking about. What ever you do, follow your interest. And when you are ready, jump into the conversation.  That's really when the fun begins.

And of course, [let us know what you think](http://ventwits.com/ventures/%5Eventwits/needs/!feedback).  We're listening.
