Putting a 'dent a in the universe' is the goal of many mission-driven ventures. Those that succeed will create the new normals for a more vibrant, sustainable, and inclusive future. At [Possibilian](https://possibilian.vc), we call them transformative ventures.

Seeking and achieving transformative impact is what we are most interested in. It's also different than achieving incremental improvements, regardless of how valuable they might be.

To bring more colour to the differences, and what we're most excited about in the years ahead, we're pleased to share our perspective on:

- Where does transformative potential comes from?
- What are the current hotspots for transformative potential?
- What do transformative ventures look like?
- How can ventures manage for transformative outcomes?

Here's to a better future, sooner.
