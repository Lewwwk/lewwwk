I commented on Fred Wilson's [Looking Forward](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/05/looking-forward.html) post yesterday and he reblogged a part of my comment in his tumblog [here](http://fredwilson.vc/post/34956572#disqus_thread). Tt's been generating a few emails to me so for those that are interested, here are a few other links that follow that theme...

-- A few of us are convening an event that is digging deeper into that mindset that riffs off open source [openeverything.net](http://openeverything.net).
-- Ervin Laszlo's [Macroshift](http://lewwwk.com2007/10/macroshift-ervin-laszlo-doomsday-or.html) -- a book about the evolution of civilization and the interplay of technology and mindsets (my highlights and links to the book -- additional post [here](http://lewwwk.com2007/11/rest-of-macroshift.html))
-- A post of mine on this phase we are in that I'm calling "[the Great Remix](http://lewwwk.com2008/05/great-remix.html)". Additional posts [here](http://lewwwk.com2008/05/doing-differently-in-great-remix.html) and [here](http://lewwwk.com2007/11/rest-of-macroshift.html).
-- [Stafford Beer's work](http://lewwwk.com2007/10/higlights-from-of-enterprise-viable.html) on information design of systems in an organizational context (my highlights and links to his book and work)
