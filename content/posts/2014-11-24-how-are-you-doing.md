It's a simple question and it's the heart of [Pine](http://pineHQ.com)'s daily check-in. As [we](http://igniter.com)'ve been building Pine over the last six weeks, I've answered it about 120 times. This is my experience.

At the beginning I'd look at the question, not sure where to start. Often I'd quickly tap in a few words. Sometimes those words turned into paragraphs. Sometimes I'd check-in with a simple emoticon.

After a while, I started noticing things throughout the day. Little thoughts. Sudden reactions. Sometimes I'd reach for Pine and tap them in. Sometimes I'd just pause and watch them play out. And then, it hit me. There was a pattern in my responses, a common theme lurking below the surface that had been shaping my days. Now it's not like I've even done much to change that pattern yet, but simply noticing it lessened its influence and my days are noticeably flowing a little more lightly. Not bad for a simple question.

Looking back, Pine also helped set the stage in a few other ways.

First it's private. These are my experiences, my thoughts, expressed in a way that's unfiltered and unedited. Not shared, they are raw and real.

Second, the simplicity. I can check in just about anywhere at any time, and I can do it in a few seconds whether I think I have anything to say or not.

Third, while it's private, I'm not alone. I can't see what my friends are saying, but I know that they are checking in. It's like we're walking [the Camino trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) together, silently nodding to each other as we discover a little more of ourselves with every step.

In summary, our lives are made up of the experiences we collect every day. In that journey, Pine is my silent partner, helping me pay attention to whatever happens. Founder bias aside, I think that's something we can all benefit from.
