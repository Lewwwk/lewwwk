Well, it was only a few months ago when [Jason [Mogus]{#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-error}](http://communicopia.net/who-we-are/our-team/jason-mogus), [Mark [Surman]{#SPELLING_ERROR_1 .blsp-spelling-error}](http://commonspace.typepad.com/about.html) and I chatted on this concept of the event series that is now underway. It started as an exploration as to a new [Web Of Change](http://webofchange.com) event at Hollyhock this year and Mark has taken it to what is going to be an amazing series that is going to push our thinking and the thinking of the 'open' community even further.

For more information, check out Mark's opening post [here](http://commonspace.typepad.com/commonspace/2008/06/open-everything-right-here-right-now.html), and the [[openeverything]{#SPELLING_ERROR_2 .blsp-spelling-error} wiki](http://openeverything.net).

> Today, Toronto kicks off [Open Everything](http://www.openeverything.net/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}: a global series of six (or more?) events about the art, science and spirit of open. We've got 60 amazing people registered who come from computer programming, community development and everywhere in between. It's gonna rock.

There are going to be a few [bloggers]{#SPELLING_ERROR_3 .blsp-spelling-error} and hopefully a few twitters going live today and putting their follow-up thoughts out shortly thereafter... and I'll do my best to link to them as they come available.
