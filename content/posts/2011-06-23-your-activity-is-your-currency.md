At [Epic](http://epic.io) we're introducing Epicredits as a currency to help you reward and accomplish what matters to you. You can [signup now](http://makeitepic.com/r/av9iWUHOTP%20) to start collecting and get notified when it's live later this year.

For those who want to learn more, read on...

[Epic](http://epic.io) is based on the realization that more and more of what we do produces a signal in the cloud. Whether it's a tweet, a document update, a blog post or a bookmark there's a record of it somewhere. In fact, when someone is trying to get your attention, even if it's a simple as clicking a link, it's a share of your activity that they want.

Of course, not all activity is of equal value. We believe it's most valuable when it helps accomplish something that matters or when it leads to more activity in the future. In other words, it's most valuable when it helps build a better future, sooner.

Epicredits wrap those two threads into a single currency, like this: 1) As you do your work on the web, you'll collect Epicredits for your activity; 2) You'll earn more for activity that's related to something that matters or leads to more activity in the future; and 3) You'll get to use your Epicredits to reward and encourage others to accomplish what matters to you.

While we're still in development, if you are interested, you can get a headstart building your currency at [http://makeitepic.com](http://makeitepic.com/r/av9iWUHOTP%20). We'll also notify you when the currency goes live later this year.

Our activity is our currency. Let's invest it in building a better future sooner. Let's [make it epic](http://makeitepic.com/r/av9iWUHOTP%20)!
