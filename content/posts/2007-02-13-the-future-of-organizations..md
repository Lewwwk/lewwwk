I just read a very interesting paper called ["The Future of Global Action Networks"](http://www.gan-net.net) (look for the document link a little ways down the page). What was interesting, was not necessarily the discussion of "Global Action Networks" but the underlying observations on how they operate and are setup. From my perspective, these approaches to organizations are going to be fundamentally important to the most relevant organizations of tomorrow.

If anyone has done or wants to do a summary of this document please let me know. I'd love to post it here.

This has been one of those rare reads for me... something I'm sure I'll be referencing for many years to come.
