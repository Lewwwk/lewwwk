Venturing on the frontiers is about the early stages of taking on big challenges. It's a space where conventional models to planning and management prove ineffective. It's the place where entrepeneurs trust their 'gut' and face the challenges with an unrelenting push forward. And it's the place from which the greatest change can come about.

I've been tapping my own experience, researching into systems science and talking with some of North America's leading venture investors who are themselves pushing the frontiers. Through all of that I've emerged with an understanding that I've tried to capture to the right. Essentially it describes a [venture]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"} as a set of spaces ('f[ounding agreement]{style="font-weight: bold;"}' which gives rise to a '[magic box]{style="font-weight: bold;"}' which operates within certain '[realms of relevance]{style="font-weight: bold;"}'). [Venturing]{style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"} then is the process of '[framing]{style="font-weight: bold;"}' those spaces, '[planning']{style="font-weight: bold;"} immediate action, and 'c[onnecting]{style="font-weight: bold;"}' to get things done and evolve the spaces. Collectively that led me to the following set of principles for venturing on the frontiers:

- Create spaces for things to happen
- Make it simple and accessible
- Tend to connections and connecting
- Keep venturing

I'll publish future posts on the implications for ventures and venture investors who are pushing the frontiers. Don't expect magic bullets, but rather a prompting of some productive questions. If anything this has reminded me is that there are no answers, only questions... and asking the right ones can make all the difference.
