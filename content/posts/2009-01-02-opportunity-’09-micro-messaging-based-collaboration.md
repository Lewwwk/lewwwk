My focus heading into 2009 is micro-messaging based collaboration. From where I sit I think it will have a profound effect on [the way we organize](http://lewwwk.com/post75) resources [to get things done](http://lewwwk.com/post62) and will mark a fundamental shift in shape of the organizations and systems of our future.

Some key features of this are:

- Broadly accessibile: easy (web-based), distributed (available in any site), portable (sms compatible)
- Action oriented: every interaction is a contribution, every contribution builds relationship
- Interest driven: fluidly find, follow, and do things that \*are\* interesting at every moment

I'm tackling this through two tracks:

- The [Social Venture Commons (SVC)](http://lewwwk.com/post339): open-source micro-messaging based collaboration platform (non-profit/charitable)
- 3P Launch Co (3PL): SVC based tool and property developer (for-profit)

Within those there are 4 core components that I already see emerging from the SVC platform:

- application to formal organizations that are incorporating a degree of peer-production (VenTwits)
- application to groups as a lightweight rapid action support system (GroupTwits)
- application to tasks for seamless real-time management
- personal context engine (semantic history)

The core platform is currently in development and I'm working on some founding partnerships for the SVC to support innovation integration, social tech incubation and organizational capacity. For the for-profit arm we are working to launch our first property (beta) by February.

In January I am seeking a seed round of up to \$250,000 invested as either charitable donation (into SVC) or as a convertible debenture into 3PL (also need a new name). The structure being resolved for 3PL will include substantial equity participation for SVC and for founding collaborators in 3PL. Further equity/revenue participation will  be designed into each tool/property created in 3PL to further support peer-production.

At the core of all of this is this notion of peer-produced organizations. We're off to a great start thanks to huge contributions by [Joseph Dee](http://www.linkedin.com/in/josephdee) and [Matt Nish-Lapidus](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattnl) and there are already [a handful of others](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23svc) starting to make their mark in this to. While I'm not stupid enough to think this is going to be easy or that there is any guarantee of success by conventional measures, everything in my experience and my body tells me that we are hitting on something that has the potential to make profound change and we're going to have a heck of a great ride trying.

There's never been a better time to make change -- and [never been a time where we as global citizens are as much in need](http://lewwwk.com/post156). Giddyup!
