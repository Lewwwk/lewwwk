The impacts of climate change are everywhere, giving rise to new risks and accelerating the need to adapt our physical infrastructure and societies. Regulators are introducing new regulations to disclose those risks to protect the financial system. Investors are adjusting portfolios and adopting new products to accelerate infrastructure adaptation to manage risk and returns. Governments are planning large-scale investments into new infrastructure to prepare for an uncertain future. People are wondering if they are safe and secure where they live and work.

Better data, and inference of those changes, are a key lever in being able to minimize those risks and accelerate the transition to a climate-compatible future. This is easier said than done. Waves of new data are coming online as the cost of sensor and data collection declines, and a flood of new techniques for analysis and inference makes it harder than ever to keep up.

This is where [Climate X](http://climate-x.com) comes in. Climate X is building a unified data ingestion and inference platform from the ground up to enable dynamic, detailed scenarios of asset-based physical and economic impacts from climate change. They call it a digital twin of the earth. By automating data ingestion, modularly applying inference algorithms, and exposing an API for accessing the latest in climate data and intelligence they aim to build a foundational climate intelligence resource that is clear, transparent, and continuously improving to empower better decisions.

For asset owners, it means more granular insights into portfolio risks based on the changing climate and potential scenarios of action. For investment managers, it means insights into new products and investment opportunities. For governments and companies, it means earlier identification of climate-related vulnerabilities and better informed, long-term investment decisions. And for everyone else, it means a faster path toward a climate-compatible society.

Harnessing climate intelligence to accelerate decarbonization and adaptation is an integral part of our Transition Economy narrative. Our research initiatives into the use of [scenarios for systemic finance](https://assets.possibilian.vc/SystemicFinanceOpportunitiesInitiativeBrief.pdf), or the effects of [inter-systemic cascades](https://cascadeinstitute.org/research/inter-systemic-cascades-project/) all pointed us to the challenge of understanding and navigating the complex, systemic risks that are rippling across society. And so, today, we are excited to announce our investment in Climate X alongside [Pale Blue Dot](http://paleblue.vc), [a100x](http://a100x.com), [Blue Wire](https://bluewirecapital.com/), [New Chic](http://newchiccapital.com/), and a global group of strategic angels.

[Lukky](http://twitter.com/its_lukky), [Kamil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamilkluza/) and their growing team have come to this with first-hand experience modelling and managing risk across asset portfolios, partnering with leading experts in climate science and artificial intelligence to arrive at this new approach.
