December 18th was the first ever [StatusCamp](http://statuscamp.org). It was also another [ChangeMedium](http://ChangeMedium.org) experiment -- bringing the context of the medium of change to the developers building its future.

The event was an excellent day with over two dozen folks including the [Status.net](http://status.net/ "status.net") team and [Peter Deitz](http://twitter.com/peterdeitz) of [SocialActions](http://www.socialactions.com/ "Social Actions"). It was an amazing event to learn about where Status.net and the [OpenMicroBlogging](http://openmicroblogging.org/ "OpenMicroBlogging") initiative (OMB) are going. The wiki has [more details on OMB](http://status.net/wiki/OpenMicroblogging_and_Federation) but it is due for a major new release and will be integrating [PubSubHubBub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/), [ActivityStrea.ms](http://activitystrea.ms), [Salmon](http://www.salmon-protocol.org/), and [WebFinger](http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/ "WebFinger"). What this means is an integration of emerging protocols to put people at the centre of micro-messaging. Not only is this a positive protocol development, but it signals the collaboration of major participants in this field to create an 0pen, interoperable system -- an essential aspect of the medium of change.

I also presented a new pitch (below) on why all this really matters to all of us. It prompted a good session on [social uses for Status.net](http://status.net/wiki/Social_Use_of_StatusNet) and sparked a number of unexpected side conversations. What I'm learning more and more is that many developers have a social streak -- a bent for making the world better. Many don't publicize it but it seems that most do. This is encouraging as I look forward to future ChangeMedium events and seems to fit with the notion of bringing research, development, and application together to build this medium better.

Following that thread, I received some great suggestions for ways to do just that including compiling social use cases for developers to hack, doing developer challenges -- prizing the best apps/hacks, and focused dev days to tackle specific problems. I'm interested in all ideas like this -- they give fodder for communities who want to create events that move and make this medium for all of us.

If you want to dig into the details there's a pretty comprehensive wiki up with [notes from the event](http://status.net/wiki/StatusCampMontreal) (update: [good summary post](http://status.net/2009/12/22/statuscamp-montreal-and-make-your-own-statuscamp) from [Jon Philips](http://identi.ca/rejon) too). Here also is the context presentation I piloted at the event.
