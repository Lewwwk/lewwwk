Things have been moving quickly in the last few weeks and I'm happy to say that we're in development on the Social Venture Commons. I've created a more descriptive presentation below and have also included a brief primer on peer production of organizations (a quick snapshot of the #hohoto holiday party in Toronto).

I'm working on initial partnerships for the commons and am getting ready to reach out for seed investment for one of the for-profit properties (VenTwits.com).

In the spirit of peer-producing this as we go below are some specific items we'd love to have taken up. Just post in the comments below or ping me directly.

- Identity design
- Interface design
- Research on venture media and group collaboration property acquisitions
