[lost and found: A Special Request](http://patpitingolo.blogspot.com/2009/02/special-request.html).

I've been thinking a lot lately on how this happens. As an [entrepreneur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur "Entrepreneur"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} interested in a better future, sooner there are endless examples to point to. [Grameen Bank](http://www.grameen-info.org/ "Grameen Bank"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"}, [Ben & Jerry's](http://benjerry.com), [Stonyfield Farms](http://stonyfield.com), [Linux](http://www.kernel.org/ "Linux"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"}, the [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"}, the Web, [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org "Wikipedia"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"}, and [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/ "Craigslist"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"} are all ones that come to mind for different reasons.

The one thing that seems universal in all these is passion, that unmistakable blend of purpose and persistence that drives things forward.  It's what brings that small group together to get something done, when no one really knows yet what they are doing or how it will happen.

Isn't it funny then (not) that the tools we most associate with getting things done (task-lists, project plans etc.) are so devoid of passion. We've somehow come to think progress is painful and mechanical. Obviously it's not all rainbows and unicorns, but greatness doesn't come from a bunch of robots on an [assembly line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line "Assembly line"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} either.

Last week I noticed it in myself...

It's time to bring the passion back.
