Here's an interesting map from <http://www.xigi.net/> giving an overview of the latest initiative I'm co-creating. If you haven't checked-out [xigi]{#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-error}.net... take a look. A very interesting tool that's growing quickly and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the global marketplace that invests in good. Anyone else get the feeling that this 'marketplace' is really starting to take off?
