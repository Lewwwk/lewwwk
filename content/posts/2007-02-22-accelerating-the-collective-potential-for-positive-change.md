I've just come across [www.slideshare.net](http://www.slideshare.net) and figured I'd try it using the latest version of the presentation ([here](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/the-collective-potential-for-positive-change/)) that I'm working with on the topic of accelerating the collection potential for positive change.

Let's see how this works... and of course... I'm always interested in feedback!
