I've started an experiment to share how I think about 'transformative' or 'future defining' ventures.

Transformative potential is the core of what we look for at [Possibilian](https://possibilian.vc) and it can be hard to describe. In our [thesis](https://possibilian.vc/#thesis) we talk about it as the potential to:

> ...change the way we think and act, shift power and relationships, and create the foundations of a vibrant, sustainable and inclusive future.

But what that looks like and how a venture might get there is not often obvious. Using basic diagrams and the constraint of short-form video I'm going to see if I can make it a little easier to dive in and explore.

I'd like to do one a week for now, and refine the approach to see what works best.

The first one is below. Watching at 2x can get it down to ~2min which is where I'd love to be. 🚀

(While there is always more I could do, suggestions that might make them simpler and faster to produce are particularly 👍.)
