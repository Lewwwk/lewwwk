Pardon the profanity, but I'm tired of the bullshit.

People like to be right. Often being right means making other people wrong. This is not productive.

Saying that it is productive because you are engaging in debate... does not make it productive either.

All you are really doing is trying to win to be right. And who does that help? You. Who doesn't it help? Everyone else.

If you want to be productive, contribute. Instead of being right, help the recipient of your righteousness try and explore their issue further. And if you find you're not learning through the conversation then, again, stop trying to be right. If you can't do that, shut up and do something else.

So, self-righteousness rant complete, time to get back to work.

Peace, love, and let's fix this mess.

PS... if you ever find yourself in conversation with me and find yourself a recipient of righteousness... please, please, please call my bullshit. We'll save ourselves a lot of time.
