A thought occured to me that there are in essence two fulcrums in the intentional creation of a transformative venture (a venture working on a systems-depth shift/consciousness change) -- and those are the purpose and the business system. And perhaps these two fulcrums interplay through another fulcrum -- the [BHAG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHAG_%28Goal%29).

This is coming to me as I'm exploring the connection between the Venture Vortex model and [Stafford Beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer)'s [Viable System Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_System_Model). More posts on these later but this seems like it is starting to come together.
