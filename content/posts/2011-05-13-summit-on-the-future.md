The [future of organization](http://lewwwk.com/post6907) has arrived. Like with sustainable coffee, cleantech, and the social trifecta (entrepreneurship/finance/innovation) before,  I've noticed the shift in conversation from "no that will never happen/it must be stopped at all costs" to, "it's happening or inevitable/how can I play". It's the shift from an avoidable future to an inevitable reality.

Historically for me, this is a time to shift fully from thinking to doing. And yet, I know it is the time when the opportunity for understanding really begins. So, as I sit here in the wee hours of the morning wondering why I am writing this post, I realize that I'm hoping for someone to hold the space for this thinking to shift to the next level to. While I'm not sure exactly what that is, [Jean Russell](http://nurture.biz/about/jean-russell/) seems to capture the direction in [her post on integration](http://thrivable.net/2011/05/integration/).

Whether it's a conversation, a summit, a series or something other... here's a few people I'd love to see carrying it on, together.

While I know it's not me to hold this space, I hope someone sees the opportunity in making it happen. We're at the front of generation of opportunity with an opportunity that will shape our civilization into the future.
