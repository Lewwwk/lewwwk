Following up on my conversation post earlier... I just got off the phone with another connection by the same person. The 'magic' happened again. This time I consciously took my learning from the previous post into the call and it took the conversation even further. I guess it's not really magic after all. My gratitude for the relationships I have just continues to grow. Thanks!
