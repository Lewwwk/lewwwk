A little over a year-ago I began considering [what's next in my journey](http://lewwwk.com/post3) and exactly 3 months ago I [initiated my first inquiry](http://lewwwk.com/post29) into what's needed on the [frontiers of venturing and venture investing](http://lewwwk.com/post40). It hasn't been a linear journey of course, with a good deal of my attention going towards getting [Causeway](http://causeway.socialfinance.ca/) going over the last year.

While that was ongoing, I had about a dozen conversations over November and December with some extraordinary social venture investors and funds in North America (including [Renewal Partners](http://www.renewalpartners.com/), [Social Capital Partners](http://www.socialcapitalpartners.com/), [Kellogg Foundation](http://www.wkkf.org/default.aspx?LanguageID=0), [RSF Social Finance](http://www.rsfsocialfinance.org/), [Good Capital](http://www.goodcap.net/) and others). To all of you I am tremendously grateful for the generosity of your time, the candor with which you shared your experiences and the enthusiasm with which you've approached this exploration. Each conversation integrated into my own experiences and readings, and into every other conversation. What has emerged for me is a point of summary from which I feel ready to attempt some active experiments into how do we get better on the frontiers as venturers and venture investors.

What follows now is a series of posts on:

- [The dynamics of the frontier: complex ambiguity](http://lewwwk.com/post49)
- [Venturing on the frontier: requisite attention](http://lewwwk.com/post51)
- [Gettin' it done without goin' under: cohesion and incipient instability](http://lewwwk.com/post52)
- [Giddy-up: getting better on the frontier](http://lewwwk.com/post54)

Onward...
