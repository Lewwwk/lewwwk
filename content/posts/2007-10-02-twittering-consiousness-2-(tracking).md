::: entry-content
Twitter just announced the ability to track words in the entire '[twittersphere]{#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-error}'. I for example am now tracking:\
-- systemic\
-- intervention\
-- co-create\
-- venture\
-- Canada\
-- Byron

So when anyone does a post with any of those words in it I'll see it. It's interesting to me because I can in a way tap into a broad consciousness flow (comprised of small top-of-mind comments) to see what's happening with these words. Will be interesting to see how this goes -- I imagine at lease I'll find some interesting new people to follow -- and that so far has proven to be a good thing.
