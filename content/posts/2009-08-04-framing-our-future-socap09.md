<!-- Image unavailable -->I'm looking forward to this year's [Social Capital Markets conference](http://socialcapitalmarkets.net). [Last year](http://socialfinance.ca/blog/2008/12/opportunity-amidst-crisis-a-recap-of-social-capital-markets-conf/) I came way with a sense of a movement -- a long term movement that was working with the balance of social and financial objectives in service of a better world for all. I'm sure this year will do much of the same -- bringing the best of the movement together to share their progress and inspire those who are looking to explore 'the intersection of money and meaning'. If you are interested in this space, [it's the place to be](https://www.reg-services.com/socialcapitalmedia/socap09/).

This year though, I'm going with a more ambitious agenda. [Jessica Margolin](http://www.margolin-consulting.com/about.html) hit on something in [her SoCap09 post](http://www.margolin-consulting.com/2009/08/socap09.html) -- encapsulated in these 2 quotes:

*"For me, the debate question was upside-down. It should be: How can we maximize financial returns given our drive to maximize social returns."*

*"The question isn't how to fit what we love into the structure of our money-making, the question is how to be productive given our need to engage with our lives."*

Since the last conference we've seen the depths of shifts underway in the financial system come along with continuing instability in our political and ecological systems. If we weren't clear last year the core systems of our society are in transition. And since last year's conference, we've seen the birth of t[he most accessible, participatory medium in history](http://lewwwk.com/post436) and the start of what [Om Malik](http://gigaom.com/author/om/) calls an [interaction society](http://omis.me/2009/04/14/what-twitter-broadband-internet-mean-to-me/). While it's great to see people working on shifting our existing institutions and systems, we're coming to this conference with a capacity for reinvention unlike any time in history.

The opportunity to me in this gathering is to create a space for a new conversation... a sub-track for folks interested in hacking new systems that support a civilization founded on the answer to more human questions than how do we maximize production.

This week's [#SoCap09](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23SoCap09) twitter chat should help kick that off. We'll be looking into the question of how is social media changing change? I'm curious to see what threads emerge and what we can take into the conversation at the conference.

The game is changing more than we realize and in ways we don't yet understand... so let's ask some questions... let's hack some solutions... let's get to it.
