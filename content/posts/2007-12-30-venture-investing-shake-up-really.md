An interesting article about a new way of doing deals <http://mobile2.wsj.com/beta2/htmlsite/html_article.php?id=1&CALL_URL=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119889558568757053.html> (thanks to Fred @ USV <http://avc.blogs.com> for the pointer).

What this article really seems to be dancing around is value of relationships in finding and doing deals and in venture success. What also comes is the conventional approach of being hands-off if you are going in early and also the power of being lean/lightweight in early-stage venturing. I\'m in the midst of doing a series of posts from my lastest conversations on the frontiers of venturing and this fits... and it\'s also a good reminder of how little really is changing on the frontiers.

We\'ll see if what I\'m working on will change that any. I sure hope so... we\'re leaving a lot on the table when it comes to venturing and venturing for good. We really must be able to get better at this as venturing is simply the process of organizing people and actions to get something done. Is that really so mysterious? 🙂
