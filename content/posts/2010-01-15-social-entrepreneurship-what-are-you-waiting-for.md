Tomorrow I'm presenting the deck below at the [16th Annual Environmental Sciences Symposium](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~envsymp/) at [University of Guelph](http://www.uoguelph.ca/ "University of Guelph"). I'm told to expect an audience of about 200 -- mostly undergrads. That's one of my favourite scenarios. Talking about any form of entrepreneurship to people about to embark on the rest of their lives is fun.

With the devastation in [Haiti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti "Haiti") right now though, I thought I'd try something different.

For tweets with this link (<http://tr.im/seFTW>) I'll donate another \$1 to Haiti relief efforts. For every person who starts their question to me from the audience with "Social Entrepreneurship For The Win!" I'll donate \$10. As I've already given, I'll cap this at \$100, but of course, every dollar counts.

My main message: Get involved. Get going. Don't wait, just do it.

Let me know what you think... and make me give while you're at it!
