So now with intellectual models for aligning a venture around a purposeful response to a deep calling, and for designing a viable organizational system it begs the question -- now what?

Investment. Investment of capital... intellectual, social, and financial.

In ideal clean slate this might look something like this:

1. identify a calling
2. gather a group of diverse though leaders and community members to explore/deepen the calling
3. conduct an 'externalities analysis'
4. reconvene a modified group to:
 - uncover a responsive purpose
 - concieve of a theory of change
 - and anchor it with a [Big Hairy Audacious Goal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHAG_%28Goal%29).
5. conduct an 'internalities analysis'
6. design the viable system
7. reconvene a modified group to:
 - craft strategic directions
 - establish near-term action plans

Of course this cannot be a rigidly linear/sequential process but rather is an iterative co-creative one. It is also a continual process of capital investment: intellectual, social, and financial... done in an integrated co-creative style. And that's what [I'm working on now](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/ignition-fund-i).
