I've been head-down these last 2 weeks and we're making great progress toward first launch.  For the latest action on the Social Venture Commons -- feel free to track the [twitter stream](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23svc).

The model for distributing founding equity among those that contribute is essentially set, and I've begun receiving investor commitments on both the charitable and for-profit side. Development has been greatly augmented with the code-mastery of [Dan Williams](http://twitter.com/j_dan_williams).

Will post some more fulsome reports next week.

Thanks all for your support so far!
