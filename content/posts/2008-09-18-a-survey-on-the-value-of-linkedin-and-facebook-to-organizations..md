Off the cuff, I've been talking about building a '[social capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital "Social capital"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} supercharger' over the past few months. It's actually something that I've been working more deeply with [Duncan Work](http://100trillion.wordpress.com/about/) (DW), [Duncan Holmes](http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=8445579&fromSearch=0&sik=1221260686175&split_page=1&authToken=LFNm&authType=NAME_SEARCH&goback=.nrp_1_1221260686175) and few others.

Well DW has launched a simple survey to start capturing some experiences around using [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/ "LinkedIn"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"} and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ "Facebook"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"} in organizations. Needless to say we'd be very interested in how you use them. If you're up for taking 5 minutes -- you can [take the survey here](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=YmPRsxc3TTlT2Vqq7zhrwQ_3d_3d).

We'll share the results we come up with as soon as we can.

In the meantime, [DW's post introducing the survey](http://100trillion.wordpress.com/2008/09/10/survey-how-useful-are-linkedin-and-facebook/) also has a bit more background (he's also got some great posts on social networks in general).
