I loved [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/mingyeow/discovery-is-the-new-cocaine-going-beyond-engagement) on Discovery by the Mr. Tweet folks. And today Fred Wilson had a [great post on the value of 'status updates'](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/hasnt-it-always-been-about-status.html) (I've been calling it micro-messaging).

I've been taken with the use of inline tagging as a way to enhance discovery and it's power. On twitter the @ reply and the \# tag are great examples. What we're doing with [VenTwits](http://VenTwits.com) and GroupTwits (coming soon) is adding tags that identify entities, groups, and topics. I'm no semantic expert but I've been fascinated by how people are starting to use it. In Toronto, we've seen the [#hohoto story](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/peer-production-primer-presentation) and around the world we've seen the power of tags like [#gaza](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23gaza).

By using a tag in a short 140 character message you are indicating something of particular interest to yourself. It links that message to any other message including the tag... the tag essentially creating a thread that links a common interest. By being able to tag entities, groups, individuals, and topics, we can weave a variety of threads together through a single message. The frequency of this weaving will create incredible patterns that will only get richer over time. Patterns that describe the flow of individual and collective interests.

There is so much more going on here... but I think the power of this is huge and somehow I think it has the potential to weave itself into the fabric of all our digital text messages and actually have a shot a shaping a usable semantic web.
