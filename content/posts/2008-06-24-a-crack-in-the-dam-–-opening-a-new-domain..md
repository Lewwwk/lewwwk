It's been in the works for awhile and I now think we're really starting to make a connection between web tech (2.0+), venture investing, social innovation. That connection is going to unleash some tremendous innovations and a surge in the activity directly working on the challenges facing our civilization. It feels like the emergence of a new domain that will take some very different approaches to change and influencing the course of civilization. It seems inspired by open source, technology innovation, financial risk taking, a venturing culture, and now a deepening and deeply felt realization that there are more important tasks to tend to.

I've been digging deeply into this for a while ([Venturing on the Frontiers](http://lewwwk.comsearch/label/frontiers)[,](http://lewwwk.comsearch/label/frontiers) [Open Everything](http://lewwwk.comsearch/label/openeverything) \<[site](http://openeverything.net/)\>, and [The Great Remix](http://lewwwk.comsearch/label/the%20great%20remix)) and these two posts ([Umair Haque](http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/haque/2008/06/a_manifesto_for_the_next_indus_1.html) and [Fred Wilson](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/06/am-i-bored-with.html)) have me feeling that something just shifted. What I love is that this isn't just the same old folks getting into this AND that they are coming at it from an understanding of how systems emerge. Umair uses the language of DNA and Fred is living it through his investment approach in web tech companies.

Maybe what it is, is that all the different groups I've been working/having the conversations with ([MaRS](http://www.marsdd.com/MaRS-Services/Business-Advisory-Services/Social-Innovation.html), [SiG](http://sigeneration.ca/), CSI, [Renewal Partners](http://renewalpartners.com/), [Communicopia](http://communicopia.com/), [Causeway](http://causeway.wikispaces.com/), [Tides Canada](http://tidescanada.org/), and [Good Capital](http://goodcap.net/)) are using different language to talk about the same things.

I'm not sure. What do you think? Is this just a personal moment are others sensing that some thing has shifted too?
