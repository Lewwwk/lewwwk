I've been a bit remiss in not posting this sooner. Thanks to [@ryancoleman](http://twitter.com/ryancoleman) for pulling this overview together. You can of course learn more over at [ChangeMedium](http://changemedium.org) and keep updated by joining the [group](http://group.changemedium.org). I'm enjoying the progress we're making and looking forward to sharing more and welcoming others into the fold.
