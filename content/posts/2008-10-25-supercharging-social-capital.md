I've been working with some fantastic colleagues ([Duncan Work](http://www.linkedin.com/in/duncanwork) and [Duncan Holmes](http://www.ica-associates.ca/Template/Foundations/DHprofile.cfm)) on ways to harness [social capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital "Social capital"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} (the relationship kind vs. financial kind). For me, the interest is applying it to ventures that are working toward a just and sustainable society -- but, more generally, I believe it is our most underutilized form or capital and is becoming increasingly important in the current economic downturn and the [new mode of organization](http://lewwwk.com/post75) that I see emerging.

I've also been playing with other ways of communicating in presentations and taking some cues from [VizThink](http://www.vizthink.com "VizThink"){.zem_slink rel="blog"} which I've recently been introduced to. The converegence of these two things has led to the presentation below. It's pretty basic but I'm curious about how people respond.\
