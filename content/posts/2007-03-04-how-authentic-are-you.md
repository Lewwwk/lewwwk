I just saw two interesting perspectives on connecting with what people care about. One of which is from client/collaborator [Communicopia](www.communicopia.com) in [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/communicopia-iima-core-values-presentation) and one is in [this article](http://www.canadianbusiness.com/entrepreneur/sales_marketing/article.jsp?content=20070228_103116_5132) in Canadian Business titled "Sell More by Creating Desire".

This theme is something I'm seeing more and more everyday particularly with the steady growth in popularity of social and environmental justice issues. Whether it's a company giving to a charity, creating a new product, or simply your own efforts to make a difference the durability and success are anchored in authenticity --- is it connected with the true nature of who you are as an organization or an individual?

In [the presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/communicopia-iima-core-values-presentation) the basis of this is understanding the core of who you are (as an individual or an organization), what you are here to do, and what the value is in what you have to offer. In the case of the article, the idea is more about trying to perceive what people are really seeking in their lives and give them something that aims to satiat that seeking. The trouble with trying to figure out what it is that people are seeking is that it is incredibly transient and shifts with the times and with the trends. It's also not based on what you are uniquely good at so begins to take on the feeling of a cheap knock-off, pr 'spin', or other pile of bs.

We all know that feeling of something quality, integrity, and substance when we come across it. It something that only comes when it's anchored in what's true and when the experience and communication speaks directly to the truth. That's when people can start to form real connections with the organisation or individual behind the product or message. Doing things the otherway around is well... an effort in futility... except for the consultant you've hired to work really hard to create something that doesn't exist.

That said, knowing ourselves is a very difficult thing to do. In my experience with emerging entities this takes a healthy amount of time, courage, and integrity. Think about it for yourself or your organization. Do you really know why you are here? What's the core purpose that you are here to fulfill and what's your truly unique contribution in doing that?

For a good overview and some great examples of this stuff from the organizational perspective you can purchase a great article [here](http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=410X&referral=2342). Of course, you can always go hire a consultant -- either way, good luck, you'll get what you want. Just remember -- the only thing that's authentic will be finding your truth -- not adopting someone elses.
