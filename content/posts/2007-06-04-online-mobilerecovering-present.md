::: entry-content
I've been actively putting myself online... or rather updating my online presences and trying out the tools to manage my online connections lately and having been finding myself being hyper connected and active while I'm at my computer. While I'm working I'm usually listening to music, have a variety of online tools open (google reader, basecamp, slideshare, etc.) while at the same time doing email and working on docs/presentations. When I'm in that mode I can be hyper productive... but sometimes, like an hour ago, my nervous system screams 'stop'.

I listened this time and went for a run in [Springbank Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springbank_Park) (I love where I live -- because 7 minutes the otherway and I'd be in a [Provincial Park](http://www.thamesriver.on.ca/Wetlands_and_Natural_Areas/warbler.htm) for some hilly trail running). It was a good idea as what I probably would have started to struggle with for the rest of the day came to me half way through my run.

Thinking about it I notice 3 different states that I now tend to operate in: Online (where I'm hyper connected), mobile/recovering (where my connectivity is limited or my system is still in recovery mode), or present (where I'm fully aware of just what is around me at that moment). Sometimes these states interweave with each other which is good -- and as long as I don't resist what my nervous system is telling me -- there should be a healthy balance of each.

Thanks also for the great pic post this morning Sarah of [graffiti wisdom](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahfelicity/529739211/) that took me down this path.
