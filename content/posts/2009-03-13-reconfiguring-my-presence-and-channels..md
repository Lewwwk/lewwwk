I've been unsubscribing from email subscriptions like crazy lately and have just been prompted to review my online profiles in prep for the launch of http://thread.IO.

I used to want product/org updates to come to me... ones that I had requested. That seems to be changing though. I'm shifting to reliance on curation and synchronicity like never before. That means relying on [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter"), Friendfeed, [Tumblr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog "Tumblelog") and direct notices from real people who know me to find out what's going on. It marks my trust that what needs to, will find me. This is big. And I think it's a reflection of how the social web is fundamentally changing us. I don't want new destinations I want humanly pre-filtered inputs.

In terms of profiles, I'm also finding myself less drawn to define myself by the companies/projects I'm affiliated. I seem to be trying to express who I am and am more comfortable letting the companies/projects just surface in the content. My sense is that this also relates to the gig economy where we are increasingly people who do stuff rather than people being a part of stuff that happens.

Which leads me to my final ramble... how I use this blog is changing. I will be doing more unfinished thoughts and posts as they happen. I have also been more actively on my tumblog which is more about sharing what I encounter throughout my day (my curated content).  And finally if you want a firehose of my content you can check out my [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com "FriendFeed") which grabs all the contributions I make in this social web. As I play with these things, and can find the time or help, I'll be updating this blog to bring it together in a cleaner way.

Feels like this is a transition to a new way of being. Something that's been coming, but has just become more practical. The transition will be messy but it's a great time for ideas and experimentation too.
