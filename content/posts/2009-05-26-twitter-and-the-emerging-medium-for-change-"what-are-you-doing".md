> Twitter is giving rise to the most accessible, participatory public medium in history. The implications for social change, innovation, and entrepreneurship are huge but hardly explored. In the coming paragraphs I explain what I see and call out to you, to all, to help surface what's happening and understand how it can help us create the world we want. I care because [we need change like never before.](http://lewwwk.com/post156) If that matters to you too, please read, comment, and share. Let's see where this goes.

What's going on with Twitter ([now at over 32m users -- up from just 1.6m a year ago](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124329188281552341.html)) is the emergence of a new medium based on the public micro-message -- **the most accessible, participatory public medium in history.**

Think about it. That's huge.

It's the potential for 4B people to post, read, and respond to each other. **Neither TV, radio, telephone, email, or the web have the same potential in terms of accessibility and participation.**

Enabled by its 'micro' (140 character) and 'public' attributes, the medium fosters a communications DNA that makes it a hotbed for interest-driven sharing, discovery, connections and spontaneous collaboration. Being micro, it is also SMS compatible making it work with the most distributed communication technology we have -- the mobile phone.

Social change is about people, engagement, and systems. Already, examples in citizen journalism and fundraising demonstrate some of the unique potential for real-time communication and spontaneous collaboration. #mumbai and #hudson, broke news and photos of the Mumbai terrorist attacks and the crash landing of a United Airlines flight on the hudson river well before any other media were able to report it. #daniela raised \$16,000 for a needy family in less than a week. And in less than 18 days, over a dozen people peer produced #hohoTO, a sold-out party for over 600 people that raised \$25,000 and 2t of food for the Daily Bread Foodbank. Taking it further, [reasearch is underway into how it Twitter changes how we respond to disasters](http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/disaster-experts-twitter-deadly-serious-stuff) and even politicians are embracing the transparency. If this is what be happening with 5, 10, 20 million users, what's possible when we're dealing with 100m or a billion users around the world?

Is it utopia and the solution to all our problems? Of course not. **But we are talking about a medium with core attributes that make it the more compatible with social change and innovation than any other.** This is not about 'tool or strategy' this is about the birth of a medium -- and its potential as a medium for change.

Already there are some great starts at the infrastructure ([SMOB](http://smob.sioc-project.org/), [FETHER](http://brdfdr.com/), [tr.im](http://blog.tr.im/post/165049236/tr-im-to-be-community-owned), [rsscloud](http://rsscloud.org), [laconi.ca](http://laconi.ca) etc), standards ([TwitterData](http://twitterdata.org), [MicroSyntax](http://microsyntax.org),etc.) and usage questions ([Kanter](http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/04/twitter-for-activism-tool-vs-strategy-debate-and-a-new-twitter-activism-guide.html), [Bravo](http://www.netsquared.org/blog/britt-bravo/net2thinktank-how-can-nonprofits-use-twitter), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter), etc.). But we're just starting to scratch the service. Getting to the roots of this and how we can use it to make change needs a focus on social change and a coordinated strategy. Key tracks for that are:

- surfacing what's already happening in terms of use, research, and potential for social change;
- studying the impacts and implication of the medium on making change; and
- encouraging systems and standards that optimize the medium for public benefit (more on that in my [previous post](http://lewwwk.com/post428)).

**So let's get to it.** This medium is here to stay and the potential for change making is profound. What have you seen? What do you think? ["What are you doing?"](http://twitter.com) **Please do comment, share and let's take this forward.**
