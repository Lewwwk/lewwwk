\*\*\* [SESSION WIKI](http://theconvo.wikispaces.com) NOW LIVE \*\*\*
Those who know me know that this is a persistent theme with me -- and now provoked by [\@josephdee](http://twitter.com/josephdee) -- maybe it's time to take this into a more focused conversation with a few more folks.

**Premise:**

1. The way of the world is [borked](http://lewwwk.com/post156).
2. The web (among other things) is shifting the way we organize resources, ourselves and create new things (**W**)
3. From that (in part) is emerging a [new mode of organizing](http://lewwwk.com/?s=mode+org+resource) where the organization itself (not just the product) is peer produced (**PP0**).
4. [Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design "Design") is the essential process of intentionally creating things (**D**)
5. 'Un-borking' our world means creating our future through **W+PPO+D**.

**The conversation I'd like to have:**

- is this premise (or something close to it) something that we really buy into?
- if so, what does it mean to put it in practice ourselves?
- how do we weave it into the practices of others?
- what are we (each individually and collectively) doing about it?

**So I ask, what do you think about the premise, the conversation, and do you want to participate in this conversation (or maybe you are already having it)?**

A couple of us have floated the idea of having a conversation at [MaRS](http://marsdd.com) the morning of Dec. 11th. If you are interested -- comment below or ping me directly.

*\*\*\* Some other things that have come up in subsequent conversations around this -- not sure yet how it will fit into the conversation but keep firing away.*

- The role of mindset is fundamental
- 'Spiritual' development and the question of "what am I" has a potentially significant role
- My past work around ['The Great Remix'](http://lewwwk.com/post67) may lend to this too
