Coming to [SoCap09](http://socialcapitalmarkets.net) has proved to be a good opportunity to integrate a number of threads I've been exploring over the past few years. Accelerated by a[n exploration](http://complexityrising.tumblr.com/post/156072054/wise-investments-mission-impact) with [Jeremy Heigh](http://www.sifteverything.com/about/jeremy-heigh/) and crystalized through provocative conversations with [Stephen Huddart](http://twitter.com/stephenhuddart) and [Tom Reis](http://www.salzburgglobal.org/2009/includes/FacultyPopUp.cfm?IDSPECIAL_EVENT=371&IDRecords=20038), here's the perspective I now find myself now arriving with.

We know **complexity is rising and change is quickening**. The [systems of society](http://www.theory-talks.org/2008/08/theory-talk-13.html) are reaching their limits. Our interventions are having more impact. **Repercussions ripple [up, down, across systems](http://complexityrising.tumblr.com/post/170530616/snapshot-of-complexity-theory)**.

**We're responding with rigor**, [improving our understanding, building models, measuring, and evaluating our progress](http://complexityrising.tumblr.com/post/168399016/a-snapshot-of-social-metric-developments). And yet we know better than ever that while we aim for impact, change is erratic.

Adding to this we have the mess of mobile, [open](http://lewwwk.com/post75), and the [social web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web "Social web"). **We don't know yet fully what it means but we know it's playing a role.** We know [it's not just about tools](http://lewwwk.com/post464) and technology, it's about culture and community.

So now, for SoCap, I'm coming clearer on my agenda. In addition to my role with the [Canadian contingent](http://socialfinance.ca/blog/2009/08/canadians-at-socap09/), my invitation to discuss [Community Power](http://cpfund.ca) as the next [asset class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_allocation "Asset allocation"), the upcoming launch of [ChangeMedium](http://slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/ChangeMedium)... **I'm playing with the opportunity in using '[social media](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media)' to improve the way we sense and respond to events, intersects and shifts in systems up, down, and across the layers of change (e.g. venture, portfolio, mission).** While I have ideas and intentions on what that looks like -- I know I can't know what it will end up.

If this interests you too, track me down and we'll see where this goes.
