This is a nice argument for stopping the debate on climate change and getting on with it.  I don't believe in the only answer to be policy change but it is an important one.  The basic argument is this:

-- we can't know for certain whether or not we are impacting climate change or what will happen\
-- we can only choose whether or not we are going to do something about it\
-- that choice really comes down to an assessment of the risk in acting or not\
-- if we act, worst case is economic downturn\
-- if we don't act, worst case is economic downturn PLUS other global catashrophies

Pretty 'simple' choice in the end isn't it.
