I'd heard of [TechStars](http://techstars.org "TechStars"){.zem_slink rel="homepage"} before and never thought too much about it -- 'another incubator' is how I filed it. Well one of my highlights from StartupEmpire was hearing [David Cohen](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-cohen "David Cohen"){.zem_slink rel="crunchbase"} of TechStars. Half-way through it struck me... why don't we do a TechStars for Social Ventures at Hollyhock.

[![](/images/cimg6976-on-flickr-photo-sharing-j5wap4.jpg)](/images/cimg6976-on-flickr-photo-sharing-j5wap4.jpg)The TechStars model is about an intense 3-month period for 10 ventures to gather, develop and launch their concepts, and gain support from venture veterans and each other. [Hollyhock](http://www.hollyhock.ca/cms/) is a place for 'non-virtual social networking' and has hosted the social change and venture communities for over a decade. It's a magical place and I think this would be an extraordinary experiment.

I also, through [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Igniter), heard that Jon Gosier of [Appfrica](http://appfrica.net) ([\@appfrica](http://twitter.com/appfrica)) is working on TechStars in [Uganda](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=0.316666666667,32.5833333333&spn=10.0,10.0&q=0.316666666667,32.5833333333%20%28Uganda%29&t=h "Uganda"){.zem_slink rel="geolocation"}. There must be others thinking about doing this for social ventures/innovation. Seems like a no-brainer and the TechStars model is 'open'. Anyone? Anyone?
