The shifts underway at [civilizational](http://lewwwk.com/post6800) and [organizational](http://lewwwk.com/post6907) levels are of course happening at the personal level too. That shift, which was touched on in each of [Power of Pull](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Pull-Smartly-Things-Motion/dp/0465019358/), [Future of Management](http://www.amazon.com/Future-Management-Gary-Hamel/dp/1422102505/) and [Heart of Enterprise](http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Enterprise-Classic-Beer/dp/0471948373/) (see [last post](http://lewwwk.com/post6907)), is best brought forth in [Dan Pink](http://danpink.com)'s latest book [Drive](http://www.danpink.com/drive). If you haven't read the book or seen either of his [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html) or RSA Animation (see below), it's definitely worth it. 

One of the most popular quotes captures it well:

> Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives.

He goes on to explain to that this drive also relates to purpose:

> The most deeply motivated people -- not to mention those who are most productive and satisfied -- hitch their desires to a cause larger than themselves.

Given that [organizations](http://lewwwk.com/post6907) and our [civilization](http://lewwwk.com/post6800) are systems of people, this becomes a key perspective in understanding how organizations are changing and civilization might pivot.  It also explains part of the popularity of the mobile, social web and its role in building a better future, sooner.

Personally I've benefitted from social communities for running, unschooling, and entrepreneurship. There is no question that I would not have been able to pursue as full a life as I have without them. And for most people who use the social web, I'm sure the experience is much the same. For the rest of you, don't worry, this is just getting started. Take a look at the video below, think about what drives you and take the plunge... even if it's just a few clicks at a time. There's an ocean of awesome on whatever matters to you.
