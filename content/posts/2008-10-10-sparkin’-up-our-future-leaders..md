I was invited by Maria Antonakos of [Opus Philanthropy](http://opusphilanthropy.com) to speak to her Philanthropy class in the Commerce program at the [DeGroote School of Business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGroote_School_of_Business "DeGroote School of Business"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} at [McMaster University](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.2625,-79.9225&spn=0.01,0.01&q=43.2625,-79.9225%20%28McMaster%20University%29&t=h "McMaster University"){.zem_slink rel="geolocation"} in [Hamilton](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.2552777778,-79.8730555556&spn=0.1,0.1&q=43.2552777778,-79.8730555556%20%28Hamilton%2C%20Ontario%29&t=h "Hamilton, Ontario"){.zem_slink rel="geolocation"}. She asked me to talk about [social finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_finance "Social finance"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"} and 'a little bit about how you ended up doing what you do".

I prepared the short presentation below to give the overview of [social finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_finance), [social enterprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise "Social enterprise"){.zem_slink rel="wikipedia"}, and [social innovation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_innovation) but somehow ended up getting into some fun rants about making choices to venture toward a just and sustainable society. I learned that they were just beginning to make their career choices and over the conversation I realized what an extraordinary privilege we have in our society to take risks and know that if we fail there is a strong support structure around us. Our main fears of failure relate to ego -- not survival. Ironic really because if we don't take risks and venture forward to create a better future we are playing with the possibility that we actually put our survival at stake. A bit drastic maybe but worth a thought. Bottom line, while some think that now's a terrible time to start a business, if it's a social venture I don't think there's ever been a better time.

Apparently my rants inspired them as I've now been invited to speak at their [World Congress](http://worldcongress.mcmaster.ca/) in the Student Development track. Based on the amount of fun I had -- I can't wait to do it again!
