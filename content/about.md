My name is Michael Lewkowitz.

I am a [founder](http://igniter.com), runner, and occasional [coder](http://github.com/Lewwwk).

I invest through [Possibilian](http://possibilian.xyz), serve as Steward at [Krause House](https://krausehouse.club), and Chair at [Windfall Ecology Centre](http://windfallcentre.ca/).

Prior, I founded Clean Energy Developments (acquired by TSX:NRG), Co-Founded AmoebaCorp (acquired by John St. Advertising), and partnered and supported initiatives in social finance, venture capital, digital health, distributed systems, and community power.

I was born and raised in Toronto and now live in London, Ontario in the neighbourhood of [Old South](https://www.oscolondon.ca).

My life leans a little more [possibilian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possibilianism), a little [less dual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism).

You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Lewwwk) and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/igniter).
