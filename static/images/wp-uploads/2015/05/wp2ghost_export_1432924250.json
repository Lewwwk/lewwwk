Of course, no venture is static but rather an ever evolving mix of people and activity amidst a shifting environment. The model seeks to acknowledge the foundational element of any venture as the core ideology itself which is connected to the key people through values and the calling through purpose.\n\nThe core ideology in fact is the fulcrum around which everything pivots. It is the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">ulitmate<\/span> basis against which any planning or activity can be checked for congruence. In fact, the organization can only do what it\u2019s true purpose and values will allow \u2014 which also means we can\u2019t \u2018make-it-up\u2019\u2026 as the actual purpose and values will always express themselves.\n\nUncovering the true core ideology then is a critically important task if we are to most <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">effeciently<\/span> build an organization to serve it.

Perhaps that will help serve as some intriguing context.\n\n(oh and by the way\u2026 I found the ones at the end to be the most fun).\n\n+++++++++++\n\n\u201c\u2026 the viability of any enterprise. This is not meant in purely economic sense; it refers to the ability of the enterprise to maintain a separate existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery viable system contains, and is contained in, a viable system. This conept of an organizational nest is crucial to this account of how enterprises really work, and is contrasted with the orthodox concept of hierarchy.\u201d\n\n\u201cA System consists of a group of elements dynamically related in time according to some coherent pattern. \u2026 this System has a PURPOSE \u2026 (which) is you the observer of the System who recognizes its purpose. \u2026 it means that we have to agree on the CONVENTION about the nature, the boundaries, and the purpose of any System before we can agree on what is to count as a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot successfully handle any system that we are disposed to manage unless we obtain an insight into its nature. That nature, as we have seen, has to do with purposes, with boundaries, and with other matters which are not customarily investigated within our institutions\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery Good Regulator of a System must be a Model of that System\u201d\n\n\u201cViable: able to maintain a separate existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe metasystem exists to undertake whatever functions are required to procure coherence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt any point on the diagram, then, these orthogonal forces (operation, coherence) interact. It is that interaction with DEFINES FREEDOM within the viable system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe metasystem must make some intervention, and should make only that degree of intervention that is required to maintain cohesiveness in a viable system. Cohesiveness is however a function of the purpose of the system. \u2026 Freedom is in principle a computable function of systemic purpose as perceived.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor, if the systemic purpose is subjective, only agreement of the heart will justify a given level of cohesion in any institution.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 the synergistic formula must lie in the intersect of all the elemental operations.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 the cybernetic policy of freedom: minimal intervention, in aid of cohesiveness plus synergy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf STRUCTURE there is almost nothing to say, beyond the \u2018machine for apportioning blame\u2019 that the organization chart comprises.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen two models of each other converge, learning has occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney can be made available, one way or another, sooner or later, so long as the system remains (and is observed to remain) viable. That is why I have previously described the availability of money as a constraint rather than as a condition. \u2026 the really scarce resources need for this investment are those of time, talent, care, attention\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cClosure is the talisman of identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very notion of recursiveness embraces the notion of local closure at any given level of recursion.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 plans should be continuously adaptive to fresh information.\u201d\n\n\u201cOften some aspect of a matter is measured because that is the easiest aspect to slap a number on, and by now it is the traditional and the accepted thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cFigures are useful only to the extent that we use them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe measures we use do not have requisite variety to absorb the variety of that which they claim to measure.\u201d\n\n\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fact<\/span>: that which is the case.\u201d\n\n\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Noise<\/span>: A meaningless jumble of signals.\u201d\n\n\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Data<\/span>: statements of fact.\u201d\n\n\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Information<\/span>: that which CHANGES us.\u201d\n\n\u201cData become information \u2013 when the <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">fact <\/span>in them is susceptible to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">action<\/span>. How can I possibly know that I am <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">informed<\/span>? \u2014 Only because I have <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">changed my state<\/span>.\u201d\n\n\u201ca manager is a human being who has refined the brain\u2019s ability to recognize patterns, and to compare the key characteristics of such patters, in the context of extremely complicated systems comprising men, materials, machinery, and money;\n\nhe has become skilled in recognizing a change in his own state, by recognizing information in the data flowing around him <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and<\/span> in the ambient noise;\n\nhe has the motive, and has cultivated the style, necessary to transduce his own change of state into a change of stat in the extremely complicated system of which he is the manager.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe manager\u2019s job is three-fold: to set the CRITERIA of stability\u2026 ; to detect instability\u2026 ; to change the criteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe manager\u2019s requirement of measurement is that it should measure stability and instability in the system that he (this being his role) has subjectively defined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe manager\u2019s information, however, is his own recognition of his own change of state.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 the criteria to which the system answers, in terms of its <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">degree<\/span> of stability, derive from the criteria of systemic viability in the context of teh total viable system \u2013 and in particular they derive from the understanding of cohesion, in which\u2026 freedom and constraint are balanced to provide a workable level of autonomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cImprovement in the management of complicated systems will not occur until managers give up the dysfunctional concept of causality, and the search for the unique case.\u201d\n\nSummarizing a few paragraphs here on what it means in terms of some measure for the system to say \u2018I am all right':  \n\u2013 we <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">normally <\/span><e.g. produce>\u2026 speaks to status quo and is measured as ACTUALITY (actuality)  \n\u2013 our <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">plan<\/span>\u2026 speaks to intention and is measured as CAPABILITY  \n\u2013 we <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">wish we could<\/span>\u2026 expresses a will to advance and is measured as POTENTIALITY.  \n\u2013 Ratios of those then indicate degrees of stability: actuality to capability is PRODUCTIVITY; capability to potentiality is LATENCY; and actuality to potentiality is PERFORMANCE.\n\n\u201c\u2026 the (senior) manager\u2026 must <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">listen<\/span> to himself doing the job. Here is closure for the viable system. It also is a form of measurement. But it is self-referential, and there is no objective measure for a measurement so defined. In the viable system called \u2018the human being\u2019, this function is usually called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">conscience.\u201d<\/span>\n\n\u201cCohesiveness is the primary characteristic of organization.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 the process of organizing itself creates a problem of fragmentation which only its capacity to provide cohesion can offset.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 planning\u2026 is actually the \u2018glue\u2019 of organizational cohesion.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 planning is a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">continuous process<\/span>.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat needs to be reiterated is that planning happens only when there is an act of deicision. This act commits resources now, so that the future may be different from what would otherwise have simply happened to us. It follows that the only planners are managers, namely those people who are entitled to commit resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe argument is to say that planning is a continuous act of adaptive decision that continually aborts.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026it is an act of decision carried out by managers empowered to commit resources to a different future. Planning is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not<\/span> an activity resulting in products called plans: it is a continuous process, whereby the process itself \u2013 namely that of aborting the plans \u2013 is the pay-off.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlans are the embodiment of intentions subscribed to at each level of recursion: since these intentions are constantly changing, and not in a homogeneous way with respect either to time or to probability\u2026, they must continually abort. The only characteristic worth detecting, measuring, reporting, or doing anything about, is incipient instability in the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great physicist (Heisenberg) showed that to examine, to measure, to interrogate, something changes its state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe model we now have, contemplated at any one level of recursion, comprises two hierarchical stages \u2013 and only two. \u2026 stage of operations inside and now, and there is the\u2026 stage that constitutes the metasystem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it (senior management) should be characterized by calm.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 infinity is a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">process<\/span>; thus to understand the process is to understand infinity without going there.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst: there is a very real barrier to modeling the recursivity of viable systems more than one system beyond that over which we have authority. Second: no <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">finite<\/span> model is possible, because we do not have requisite variety to make it; and all we can do is to contemplate the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">process<\/span> whereby such models are endlessly capable of generation. And that is to define the infinite recursion; and that is to explode into self-consciousness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are two features about instability that need a lot of careful consideration. The first is that instability may set in anywhere in the behaviour of the organization, and at any time. the second is that there are always pre-symptoms of the fact. Unfortunately, the typical management information system\u2026 is repetitiously reporting on stability \u2013 it is in fact challenging the manager to find evidence of this crucial instability in the welter of routine data. If, nonetheless, he finds it, he does so because instability has already set in \u2013 it is in fact too late to avert it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut suppose that we can acquire data about stability that can be transformed into infomration (which changes us) about the possibility, the likelihood, of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">incipient<\/span> instability: then, and only then, do we have a chance to avert it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe causal model in a complex probabilistic system does not have requisite variety to predict the future. This can be said with confidence from many theoretical standpoints: epistemological, logical, even theological, as well as cybernetic \u2013 wherein the causal model cannot possibly exhibit requisite variety.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems, may we not then say, that calm is a function of alertness. It comes from being <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">poised<\/span> to read the signs of incipient instability, in the quiet confidence that instability can be averted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe senior manager stands as he humanly is: a very finite person. But he holds many privileges, that can extend his human faculties: in expertise, through his staff and advisors; in space through telecommunications; in time through a monitored alertness to incipient instability \u2013 whenever it may come. He operates within a metasystem which, though its currency is conflict, generates a special and indeed unique comradeship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is only in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">infinite<\/span> recursion that self-consciousness occurs. It occurs for the man himself, of course\u2026 .The senior manager has to embody the self-consciousness of the institution; even if, unhappily, he does not yet know <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">himself<\/span>\u2026 \u201c\n\n\u201cBut one feature of the management centre that is quite general has to e provision for the intercommunication of the senior managers that reflects the comradeship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems likely to me that people are very accommodating to a wide range of styles; what they reject in leaders is especially insensitivity and insincerity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is that managers are themselves, and tend to use the response they see fit and the style they see fit as if these two things were unconnected. The variety analysis leads to the conclusion that this is not so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two immediate consequences of these arguments are, first that it is better to teach a manager to know himself than to know what someone supposes (without knowing the circumstances) that he ought to be; and, second, that he should understand the systemic nature of the viable system in which he operates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe final diagram shows us how everything is modifying everything else. Its contemplation is rewarding, because it finally demonstrates the foolhardiness of reductionism in senior management.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we want to classify the situations in which the manager finds himself, they are dependent on two major parameters. \u2026 The fist of course is variety, and the second is relaxation time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus in designing a regulatory system for any given situation, the first rule is to follow every significant loop through the systemic diagram, applying the variety rules that have been elucidated. The second rule is to attend to the relaxation time of the system. \u2026 The key point to note is that if the system has not returned to stability before another shock drives it once more towards instability, then the regulation is impossible. So is learning impossible, so adaptation, so evolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real concern is with the proliferating variety that must needs be absorbed; and with the time that must needs elapse before the iterative loops of the managerial system can assimilate that variety and return the representative point of the system to stability and the psychological state of the manager to its point of calm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe parameters of effectiveness\u2026 judgment, style, and relaxation time\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 we observe him (the senior manager) as personifying the self-consciousness of the enterprise. The clue was that he operates in the awareness of the infinite recursion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the senior manager success in understanding, and legislating for, his own ambiance of calm and alarm; and if he also succeeds in classifying managerial situations and his own decisions according to the tripartite model here set out (judgment, style, and relaxation time), then he may operate closure in the sense defined. And if he does <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that<\/span>, in full awareness of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">what<\/span> he is doing, then he may embody the infinite recursion as a living process.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerception fo the infinite recursion is always the goal. Perhaps the problem is that once a man or woman has reached that perception, nothing matters any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe contention seems to be that if the informational system is properly deisnged to recognize incipient instabilities, and if there is a management cnetre in which requisite metasystemic variety is shared between comradeship, then the senior management can become aware of what it is really doing.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 viable organizations <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">produce themselves<\/span>.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important, when contemplating what it is to count as the management centre, to consider the inter-recursive algedonic signaling equipmnent. Otherwise: either the management centre will go to sleep in trance-like contemplation of the self-consciousness of the infinite recursion, or it will be overtaken by anarchists from the lower recursive levels intent on alleviating their personal pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspicion dawns that the enterprise may not only be a system that produces itself, but that this is both its definition and its purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe heart of the enterprise is embodied in its own people.

This is not meant in purely economic sense; it refers to the ability of the enterprise to maintain a separate existence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every viable system contains, and is contained in, a viable system.  This conept of an organizational nest is crucial to this account of how enterprises really work, and is contrasted with the orthodox concept of hierarchy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A System consists of a group of elements dynamically related in time according to some coherent pattern.  &#8230; this System has a PURPOSE &#8230; (which) is you the observer of the System who recognizes its purpose. &#8230; it means that we have to agree on the  CONVENTION about the nature, the boundaries, and the purpose of any System before we can agree on what is to count as a fact.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We cannot successfully handle any system that we are disposed to manage unless we obtain an insight into its nature. That nature, as we have seen, has to do with purposes, with boundaries, and with other matters which are not customarily investigated within our institutions&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every Good Regulator of a System must be a Model of that System&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Viable: able to maintain a separate existence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The metasystem exists to undertake whatever functions are required to procure coherence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At any point on the diagram, then, these orthogonal forces (operation, coherence) interact. It is that interaction with DEFINES FREEDOM within the viable system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The metasystem must make some intervention, and should make only that degree of intervention that is required to maintain cohesiveness in a viable system. Cohesiveness is however a function of the purpose of the system. &#8230; Freedom is in principle a computable function of systemic purpose as perceived.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For, if the systemic purpose is subjective, only agreement of the heart will justify a given level of cohesion in any institution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; the synergistic formula must lie in the intersect of all the elemental operations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; the cybernetic policy of freedom: minimal intervention, in aid of cohesiveness plus synergy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Of STRUCTURE there is almost nothing to say, beyond the &#8216;machine for apportioning blame&#8217; that the organization chart comprises.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When two models of each other converge, learning has occurred.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Money can be made available, one way or another, sooner or later, so long as the system remains (and is observed to remain) viable. That is why I have previously described the availability of money as a constraint rather than as a condition. &#8230; the really scarce resources need for this investment are those of time, talent, care, attention&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Closure is the talisman of identity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The very notion of recursiveness embraces the notion of local closure at any given level of recursion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; plans should be continuously adaptive to fresh information.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Often some aspect of a matter is measured because that is the easiest aspect to slap a number on, and by now it is the traditional and the accepted thing to do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Figures are useful only to the extent that we use them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The measures we use do not have requisite variety to absorb the variety of that which they claim to measure.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fact<\/span>: that which is the case.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Noise<\/span>: A meaningless jumble  of signals.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Data<\/span>: statements of fact.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Information<\/span>: that which CHANGES us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Data become information &#8211; when the <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">fact <\/span>in them is susceptible to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">action<\/span>.  How can I possibly know that I am <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">informed<\/span>? &#8212; Only because I have <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">changed my state<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;a manager is a human being who has refined the brain&#8217;s ability to recognize patterns, and to compare the key characteristics of such patters, in the context of extremely complicated systems comprising men, materials, machinery, and money;<\/p>\n<p>he has become skilled in recognizing a change in his own state, by recognizing information in the data flowing around him <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and<\/span> in the ambient noise;<\/p>\n<p>he has the motive, and has cultivated the style, necessary to transduce his own change of state into a change of stat in the extremely complicated system of which he is the manager.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The manager&#8217;s job is three-fold: to set the CRITERIA of stability&#8230; ; to detect instability&#8230; ; to change the criteria.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The manager&#8217;s requirement of measurement is that it should measure stability and instability in the system that he (this being his role) has subjectively defined.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The manager&#8217;s information, however, is his own recognition of his own change of state.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; the criteria to which the system answers, in terms of its <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">degree<\/span> of stability, derive from the criteria of systemic viability in the context of teh total viable system &#8211; and in particular they derive from the understanding of cohesion, in which&#8230; freedom and constraint are balanced to provide a workable level of autonomy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Improvement in the management of complicated systems will not occur until managers give up the dysfunctional concept of causality, and the search for the unique case.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Summarizing a few paragraphs here on what it means in terms of some measure for the system to say &#8216;I am all right':<br \/>&#8211; we <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">normally <\/span>&lt;e.g. produce&gt;&#8230; speaks to status quo and is measured as ACTUALITY (actuality)<br \/>&#8211; our <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">plan<\/span>&#8230; speaks to intention and is measured as CAPABILITY<br \/>&#8211; we <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">wish we could<\/span>&#8230; expresses a will to advance and is measured as POTENTIALITY.<br \/>&#8211; Ratios of those then indicate degrees of stability: actuality to capability is PRODUCTIVITY; capability to potentiality is LATENCY; and actuality to potentiality is PERFORMANCE.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; the (senior) manager&#8230; must <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">listen<\/span> to himself doing the job.  Here is closure for the viable system. It also is a form of measurement. But it is self-referential, and there is no objective measure for a measurement so defined. In the viable system called &#8216;the human being&#8217;, this function is usually called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">conscience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Cohesiveness<\/span> is the primary characteristic of organization.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; the process of organizing itself creates a problem of fragmentation which only its capacity to provide cohesion can offset.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; planning&#8230; is actually the &#8216;glue&#8217; of organizational cohesion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; planning is a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">continuous process<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What needs to be reiterated is that planning happens only when there is an act of deicision. This act commits resources now, so that the future may be different from what would otherwise have simply happened to us. It follows that the only planners are managers, namely those people who are entitled to commit resources.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The argument is to say that planning is a continuous act of adaptive decision that continually aborts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;it is an act of decision carried out by managers empowered to commit resources to a different future. Planning is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not<\/span> an activity resulting in products called plans: it is a continuous process, whereby the process itself &#8211; namely that of aborting the plans &#8211; is the pay-off.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Plans are the embodiment of intentions subscribed to at each level of recursion: since these intentions are constantly changing, and not in a homogeneous way with respect either to time or to probability&#8230;, they must continually abort.  The only characteristic worth detecting, measuring, reporting, or doing anything about, is incipient instability in the system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The great physicist (Heisenberg) showed that to examine, to measure, to interrogate, something changes its state.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The model we now have, contemplated at any one level of recursion, comprises two hierarchical stages &#8211; and only two.  &#8230; stage of operations inside and now, and there is the&#8230; stage that constitutes the metasystem.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And it (senior management) should be characterized by calm.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; infinity is a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">process<\/span>; thus to understand the process is to understand infinity without going there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;First: there is a very real barrier to modeling the recursivity of viable systems more than one system beyond that over which we have authority. Second: no <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">finite<\/span> model is possible, because we do not have requisite variety to make it; and all we can do is to contemplate the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">process<\/span> whereby such models are endlessly capable of generation. And that is to define the infinite recursion; and that is to explode into self-consciousness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are two features about instability that need a lot of careful consideration. The first is that instability may set in anywhere in the behaviour of the organization, and at any time.  the second is that there are always pre-symptoms of the fact.  Unfortunately, the typical management information system&#8230; is repetitiously reporting on stability &#8211; it is in fact challenging the manager to find evidence of this crucial instability in the welter of routine data. If, nonetheless, he finds it, he does so because instability has already set in &#8211; it is in fact too late to avert it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But suppose that we can acquire data about stability that can be transformed into infomration (which changes us) about the possibility, the likelihood, of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">incipient<\/span> instability: then, and only then, do we have a chance to avert it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The causal model in a complex probabilistic system does not have requisite variety to predict the future.  This can be said with confidence from many theoretical standpoints: epistemological, logical, even theological, as well as cybernetic &#8211; wherein the causal model cannot possibly exhibit requisite variety.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It seems, may we not then say, that calm is a function of alertness.  It comes from being <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">poised<\/span> to read the signs of incipient instability, in the quiet confidence that instability can be averted.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The senior manager stands as he humanly is: a very finite person. But he holds many privileges, that can extend his human faculties: in expertise, through his staff and advisors; in space through telecommunications; in time through a monitored alertness to incipient instability &#8211; whenever it may come.  He operates within a metasystem which, though its currency is conflict, generates a special and indeed unique comradeship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is only in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">infinite<\/span> recursion that self-consciousness occurs.  It occurs for the man himself, of course&#8230; .The senior manager has to embody the self-consciousness of the institution; even if, unhappily, he does not yet know <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">himself<\/span>&#8230; &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But one feature of the management centre that is quite general has to e provision for the intercommunication of the senior managers that reflects the comradeship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It seems likely to me that people are very accommodating to a wide range of styles; what they reject in leaders is especially insensitivity and insincerity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that managers are themselves, and tend to use the response they see fit and the style they see fit as if these two things were unconnected.  The variety analysis leads to the conclusion that this is not so.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The two immediate consequences of these arguments are, first that it is better to teach a manager to know himself than to know what someone supposes (without knowing the circumstances) that he ought to be; and, second, that he should understand the systemic nature of the viable system in which he operates.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The final diagram shows us how everything is modifying everything else. Its contemplation is rewarding, because it finally demonstrates the foolhardiness of reductionism in senior management.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If we want to classify the situations in which the manager finds himself, they are dependent on two major parameters. &#8230; The fist of course is variety, and the second is relaxation time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thus in designing a regulatory system for any given situation, the first rule is to follow every significant loop through the systemic diagram, applying the variety rules that have been elucidated. The second rule is to attend to the relaxation time of the system. &#8230; The key point to note is that if the system has not returned to stability before another shock drives it once more towards instability, then the regulation is impossible. So is learning impossible, so adaptation, so evolution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The real concern is with the proliferating variety that must needs be absorbed; and with the time that must needs elapse before the iterative loops of the managerial system can assimilate that variety and return the representative point of the system to stability and the psychological state of the manager to its point of calm.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The parameters of effectiveness&#8230; judgment, style, and relaxation time&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; we observe him (the senior manager) as personifying the self-consciousness of the enterprise. The clue was that he operates in the awareness of the infinite recursion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the senior manager success in understanding, and legislating for, his own ambiance of calm and alarm; and if he also succeeds in classifying managerial situations and his own decisions according to the tripartite model here set out (judgment, style, and relaxation time), then he may operate closure in the sense defined.  And if he does <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that<\/span>, in full awareness of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">what<\/span> he is doing, then he may embody the infinite recursion as a living process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Perception fo the infinite recursion is always the goal. Perhaps the problem is that once a man or woman has reached that perception, nothing matters any longer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The contention seems to be that if the informational system is properly deisnged to recognize incipient instabilities, and if there is a management cnetre in which requisite metasystemic variety is shared between comradeship, then the senior management can become aware of what it is really doing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; viable organizations <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">produce themselves<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is extremely important, when contemplating what it is to count as the management centre, to consider the inter-recursive algedonic signaling equipmnent. Otherwise: either the management centre will go to sleep in trance-like contemplation of the self-consciousness of the infinite recursion, or it will be overtaken by anarchists from the lower recursive levels intent on alleviating their personal pain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The suspicion dawns that the enterprise may not only be a system that produces itself, but that this is both its definition and its purpose.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The heart of the enterprise is embodied in its own people. Consultants cannot catalyse interactions that do not exist, or are persistently and perversely held at bay.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Life is a process<\/span>, not a justification.&#8221;<br \/><\/span>\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 8px;\">Blogged with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flock.com\/blogged-with-flock\" title=\"Flock\" target=\"_new\">Flock<\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 16:12:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 16:12:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 16:12:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":41,"title":"The early days of the Internet - an original CBC news story.","slug":"the-early-days-of-the-internet-an-original-cbc-news-story","markdown":"\nI just caught this in [Beth\u2019s Blog](http:\/\/beth.typepad.com\/beths_blog\/2007\/10\/this-new-thing-.html)\n\n<object height=\"366\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/SfuKWSYfuNM&rel=1&border=0\"><\/param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><\/param><embed height=\"366\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/SfuKWSYfuNM&rel=1&border=0\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" wmode=\"transparent\"><\/embed><\/object>\n\nWow\u2026 how far we\u2019ve come, in such short time, and yet how relevant the social observations remain today.\n\nBlogged with [Flock](http:\/\/www.flock.com\/blogged-with-flock \"Flock\")\n\n\n","html":"<p>I just caught this in <a href=\"http:\/\/beth.typepad.com\/beths_blog\/2007\/10\/this-new-thing-.html\">Beth&#8217;s Blog<\/a><\/p>\n<p><object height=\"366\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/SfuKWSYfuNM&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/SfuKWSYfuNM&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"366\" width=\"425\"><\/object><\/p>\n<p>Wow&#8230; how far we&#8217;ve come, in such short time, and yet how relevant the social observations remain today.\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 8px\">Blogged with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flock.com\/blogged-with-flock\" title=\"Flock\" target=\"_new\">Flock<\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 26 Oct 2007 12:04:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 26 Oct 2007 12:04:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 26 Oct 2007 12:04:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":42,"title":"Macroshift (Ervin Laszlo) --- Doomsday or Breakthrough?","slug":"macroshift-ervin-laszlo-doomsday-or-breakthrough","markdown":"\nI\u2019m only through the first two chapters of [Ervin Laszlo](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ervin_L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3)\u2018s book [Macroshift](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Macroshift-Navigating-Transformation-Sustainable-World\/dp\/1576751635\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1\/002-0269927-3836077?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1193681423&sr=8-1), but thought I\u2019d better post these snippets before I get caught-up in the flow of the week.\u00a0 I came across this through a client who pointed to this as the best description of what their work is responding to.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree more\u2026 and know a few others that will feel the same way\u2026 and am hoping more people will join those ranks.\u00a0\n\nThe [Four Phases of a Macroshift](http:\/\/igniter.tumblr.com\/post\/17689481) are the core theory and pretty easy to follow and digest.\u00a0 They are also applied directly to our current position [here](http:\/\/igniter.tumblr.com\/post\/17694101).\n\nInterestingly the book has helped me articulate the relevance of social media to my focus on transformative venturing and restoring balance among people and the planet\u2026 and it\u2019s that social media represents the first time that technology is encouraging a deepening of connections between people \u2013 a key reversal in the trend that technology has been playing since the industrialization wave that has shaped our society into the position it is in.\u00a0\n\nOne key quote in this is:\n\n\u201cThe insight emerging from this [four-phase dynamic](http:\/\/igniter.tumblr.com\/post\/17689481) is simple and straightforward.

Being on the frontier increases \u201ccomplex ambiguity\u201d<\/span> (we don\u2019t really know what we are doing, and if we think we do it\u2019s probably a false sense of security)\n\n- At the frontier, complex ambiguity emerges in each of these areas:\n- The ultimate goal\/objective is difficult to clarify in conventional quantitative terms\n- The approach needed to accomplish that goal is unsure\/unconventional\/untested\n\n- This leads to challenges in measurement and therefore tracking progress. It also has something to do with why stories are being found to be more effective in describing impact, progress, and learnings.\n- Complex ambiguity is a source of opportunity and risk, can and should be focused, but reduction\/minimization results in a corresponding reduction in potential\n- There is a strong connection to the notion of \u2018requisite variety\u2019 in general systems theory and it\u2019s application to organizations that is worth pursuing\n\n- The root questions then seem to lie in what we need to understand in terms of goals, approaches, and measures in order to be able to determine our interest, track performance, and orchestrate support.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> 2. Effective handling of complex ambiguity requires particular attention on <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">requisite competencies and internalized responsibility.<\/span>  \n<\/span>\n\n- Competencies required to handle complex ambiguity are not of the conventional functional variety\n- What they are is an important question going forward\n\n- Complex ambiguity should in no way confuse or obscure the need for the conventional competencies required by the venture\n- E.g. Just because you\u2019re trying to change the world doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to get the accounting done.\n\n- Responsibility for handling the \u2018complex ambiguity\u2019 can be carried only by those that are committed to sorting it out AND are sufficiently connected to the fields related to it\n- E.g. a conventional business partner is not likely to strive to achieve anything beyond what is specified and required \u2013 which implicitly means they are not actually dealing with the \u2018complex ambiguity\u2019\n\n- Commitment to \u2018sorting it out\u2019 is strongest in the person(s) that is (are) deeply connected to the purpose\/values of the organization\n\n- \u2018Sorting it out\u2019 is accelerated through explicit attention, should be oriented around taking action, and cannot be at the expense of the viability of the venture\n- This critical balancing point is the key determinant of the ultimate success of the organization. Too much of a focus on the ambiguity and nothing happens, too much focus on viability and the potential impact is diminished.\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> 3.

Being on the frontier increases &#8220;complex ambiguity&#8221;<\/span> (we don&#8217;t really know what we are doing, and if we think we do it&#8217;s probably a false sense of security)\n<ul>\n<li>At the frontier, complex ambiguity emerges in each of these areas:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>The ultimate goal\/objective is difficult to clarify in conventional quantitative terms<\/li>\n<li>The approach needed to accomplish that goal is unsure\/unconventional\/untested<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>This leads to challenges in measurement and therefore tracking progress.  It also has something to do with why stories are being found to be more effective in describing impact, progress, and learnings.<\/li>\n<li>Complex ambiguity is a source of opportunity and risk, can and should be focused, but reduction\/minimization results in a corresponding reduction in potential<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a strong connection to the notion of &#8216;requisite variety&#8217; in general systems theory and it&#8217;s application to organizations that is worth pursuing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>The root questions then seem to lie in what we need to understand in terms of goals, approaches, and measures in order to be able to determine our interest, track performance, and orchestrate support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">    2. Effective handling of complex ambiguity requires particular attention on <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">requisite competencies and internalized responsibility.<\/span><br \/><\/span>\n<ul>\n<li>Competencies required to handle complex ambiguity are not of the conventional functional variety<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>What they are is an important question going forward<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Complex ambiguity should in no way confuse or obscure the need for the conventional competencies required by the venture<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. Just because you&#8217;re trying to change the world doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need to get the accounting done.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Responsibility for handling the &#8216;complex ambiguity&#8217; can be carried only by those that are committed to sorting it out AND are sufficiently connected to the fields related to it<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>E.g. a conventional business partner is not likely to strive to achieve anything beyond what is specified and required &#8211; which implicitly means they are not actually dealing with the &#8216;complex ambiguity&#8217;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment to &#8216;sorting it out&#8217; is strongest in the person(s) that is (are) deeply connected to the purpose\/values of the organization<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>&#8216;Sorting it out&#8217; is accelerated through explicit attention, should be oriented around taking action, and cannot be at the expense of the viability of the venture<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>This critical balancing point is the key determinant of the ultimate success of the organization.  Too much of a focus on the ambiguity and nothing happens, too much focus on viability and the potential impact is diminished.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">   3.

Neither option suggest even modest probabilities of success particularly at the depths of the frontier&#8230; which describes the venturing and venture investing community as it currently operates.\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 8px\">Blogged with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flock.com\/blogged-with-flock\" title=\"Flock\" target=\"_new\">Flock<\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 29 Dec 2007 23:34:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 29 Dec 2007 23:34:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 29 Dec 2007 23:34:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":50,"title":"Venture investing shake-up?

It is important to note that these are a set of observations and interpretations that will continue to be evolved in practice. As such they represent a starting point for a concerted effort to \u2018get better at venturing and investing on the frontiers\u2019.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">DEFINITIONS<\/span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Venture:<\/span> An agreement among people to do things in service of a purpose and according to a set of values.\n- <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Venturing: <\/span>The process of creating and evolving a venture.\n- <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Venturer: <\/span>A person primarily involved in venturing.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">AGREEMENT: The venture profile<\/span>  \nIn getting better at venturing on the frontiers, it becomes apparent that the first things required in a venture are an articulation of:\n\n- purpose;\n- values; and\n- agreement,<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> followed by <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">action<\/span>. <\/span>\n\nThis is particularly so in an effort to address complex ambiguity and so also must include the foundational foci that are effective amidst complex ambiguity, namely distinct, discreet attention on:\n\n- [core viability](http:\/\/lewwwk.com2007\/12\/venturing-on-frontier-requisite.html) (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CV<\/span>); and\n- [the process of productive, iterative exploration](http:\/\/lewwwk.com2007\/12\/venturing-on-frontier-requisite.html) (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PIE<\/span>).\n\nThese items become the core components of a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u2018venture profile\u2019<\/span> which is an articulation of the collective agreement on what the venture is.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><\/span>Another interesting realization through these conversations and above definitions is that a venture, at it\u2019s core, is an agreement. It starts with the first agreement between 2 or more people and grows with the deepening and addition of new relationships. Essentially a venture is \u2018simply\u2019 a bundle of relationships. Accordingly the individual relationships should also receive special attention through consideration and articulation of the essential process for evolution or termination of the agreement, and of each party\u2019s:\n\n- acknowledgment of the other party\u2019s venture profile;\n- their contribution;\n- the manner of contribution;\n- their compensation for their contribution; and\n- any other explicit responsibilities and expectations.\n\nCollectively, the bundle of individual relationships along with each associated agreement form the essence of the collective agreement articulated in the venture profile and could be visualized through multidimensional maps which naturally will evolve as does the collection of individual relationships. Here there is a significant opportunity for new and improved practices in venturing. The collection of individual agreements also forms the basis for financial model. This is not the same as financial projections which are often an exercise in justifying an anticipated outcome but rather they are the basis for being meaningfully able to anticipate the results of the existing and anticipated agreements under certain conditions.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">ACTION: A planning process<\/span>  \nWith the core profile in place we move into the activity of the venture itself which is best determined by those that have the authority to complete the action being determined. This follows from observations in systems science that planning only happens when action is the result and so can only be carried out by those with the authority to act. The most effective planning approaches will be recognized as <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">intentional<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">co-creative, and iterative action planning. <\/span> Established approaches from community and software development could be well applied here. For example, the methodology from the [Institute for Cultural Affairs Technology of Participation](http:\/\/www.ica-international.org\/aboutus.htm#appro) are particularly effective when conducted with short time horizons (e.g. monthly and\/or quarterly) within the context of the venture profile which itself is reviewed periodically (e.g. annually with the inclusion of strategic direction planning). Similarly the [agile development process](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Agile_software_development) is particularly relevant for venturing on the frontiers.  \n<span style=\"font-size:130%;\">  \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GOVERNANCE: Cohesion and instability preemption<\/span><\/span>  \nGovernance of a venture (collective agreement and the action that unfolds from it) is best fulfilled through attention on the cohesion of the venture and on signals of incipient instability. Going back to the definition of a venture, this is about monitoring the changing trends in relationship status and agreements. This is perhaps the most unique discovery in these conversations. Changes in the tone of relationships is often one of the biggest and most consistent indicators of [<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">incipient instability<\/span>](http:\/\/lewwwk.com2008\/01\/gettin-it-goin-without-goin-under.html). This by no means implies that relationships should remain static or that relationships should not be allowed to decline, that\u2019s simply a part of evolution. What it does imply is that changes in the trends of relationships status are particularly powerful indicators of change including growth and incipient instability. For example what\u2019s often described as \u2018momentum\u2019 is an upward trend in the strengthening and addition of relationships. Or a founder of an organization challenging the direction the venture is taking may be an indicator of a change in the collective agreement, particularly if it was well articulated at the outset (which is rarely the case). Of course, monitoring financial metrics and changes in budget\/plans can also signal incipient instability and by no means should be excluded. Rather disciplined attention should be focused on the metrics that indicate potential instability. If the management system is attentive to incipient instability it will be able to minimize its effects or avoid it all together. The other dynamic of effective governance is attention to the [<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">cohesion<\/span>](http:\/\/lewwwk.com2008\/01\/gettin-it-goin-without-goin-under.html) of the venture itself. This means that ensuring that both PIE and CV are being attended to and that the dynamic between them is constructive.\n\nThere are of course more detailed design aspects to organizing and operating a venture, several key ones of which are described in [Heart of Enterprise](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Heart-Enterprise-Classic-Beer\/dp\/0471948373\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199722126&sr=8-1), but from my experience, research, and through the recent conversations I believe venturing effectively on the frontiers requires the essence of:\n\n- agreement and articulation of the venture (venture profile, relationship map, financial model);\n- action through intentional co-creative, iterative action planning (process, budgets, time lines); and\n- governance attentive to cohesion and able to anticipate and preempt incipient instability (future indicating metrics, report card, ability to respond constructively).\n\nPractically, there is significant opportunity in improving upon each of these areas and particularly in the area of relationships with the emergence of new ways and styles of connecting brought forth by virtual communications developments such as social networking technologies. And with that now begins the process of putting this into practice and an open invitation to those who want to embark on this with me.\n\nBlogged with [Flock](http:\/\/www.flock.com\/blogged-with-flock \"Flock\")\n\n\n","html":"<p>Coming out of this first inquiry I&#8217;m left with new definitions for venture, venturing, and venturer and also a simplistic grouping that the process of venturing essentially requires agreement, action, and governance.

As such they represent a starting point for a concerted effort to &#8216;get better at venturing and investing on the frontiers&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\" >DEFINITIONS<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Venture:<\/span> An agreement among people to do things in service of a purpose and according to a set of values. <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Venturing: <\/span>The process of creating and evolving a venture. <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Venturer: <\/span>A person primarily involved in venturing. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\" >AGREEMENT: The venture profile<\/span><br \/>In getting better at venturing on the frontiers, it becomes apparent that the first things required in a venture are an articulation of:\n<ul>\n<li>purpose; <\/li>\n<li>values; and <\/li>\n<li>agreement,<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> followed by <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">action<\/span>. <\/span> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is particularly so in an effort to address complex ambiguity and so also must include the foundational foci that are effective amidst complex ambiguity, namely distinct, discreet attention on:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com2007\/12\/venturing-on-frontier-requisite.html\">core viability<\/a> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CV<\/span>); and <\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com2007\/12\/venturing-on-frontier-requisite.html\">the process of productive, iterative exploration<\/a> (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PIE<\/span>).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These items become the core components of a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&#8216;venture profile&#8217;<\/span> which is an articulation of the collective agreement on what the venture is.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><\/span>Another interesting realization through these conversations and above definitions is that a venture, at it&#8217;s core, is an agreement.  It starts with the first agreement between 2 or more people and grows with the deepening and addition of new relationships.  Essentially a venture is &#8216;simply&#8217; a bundle of relationships. Accordingly the individual relationships should also receive special attention through consideration and articulation of the essential process for evolution or termination of the agreement, and of each party&#8217;s:\n<ul>\n<li>acknowledgment of the other party&#8217;s venture profile; <\/li>\n<li>their contribution;<\/li>\n<li>the manner of contribution; <\/li>\n<li>their compensation for their contribution; and<\/li>\n<li>any other explicit responsibilities and expectations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Collectively, the bundle of individual relationships along with each associated agreement form the essence of the collective agreement articulated in the venture profile and could be visualized through multidimensional maps which naturally will evolve as does the collection of individual relationships. Here there is a significant opportunity for new and improved practices in venturing. The collection of individual agreements also forms the basis for financial model. This is not the same as financial projections which are often an exercise in justifying an anticipated outcome but rather they are the basis for being meaningfully able to anticipate the results of the existing and anticipated agreements under certain conditions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\" >ACTION: A planning process<\/span><br \/>With the core profile in place we move into the activity of the venture itself which is best determined by those that have the authority to complete the action being determined.  This follows from observations in systems science that planning only happens when action is the result and so can only be carried out by those with the authority to act. The most effective planning approaches will be recognized as <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">intentional<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">co-creative, and iterative action planning. <\/span> Established approaches from community and software development could be well applied here.  For example, the methodology from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ica-international.org\/aboutus.htm#appro\">Institute for Cultural Affairs Technology of Participation<\/a> are particularly effective when conducted with short time horizons (e.g. monthly and\/or quarterly) within the context of the venture profile which itself is reviewed periodically (e.g. annually with the inclusion of strategic direction planning).  Similarly the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Agile_software_development\">agile development process<\/a> is particularly relevant for venturing on the frontiers.<br \/><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><br \/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GOVERNANCE: Cohesion and instability preemption<\/span><\/span><br \/>Governance of a venture (collective agreement and the action that unfolds from it) is best fulfilled through attention on the cohesion of the venture and on signals of incipient instability.  Going back to the definition of a venture, this is about monitoring the changing trends in relationship status and agreements. This is perhaps the most unique discovery in these conversations. Changes in the tone of relationships is often one of the biggest and most consistent indicators of <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com2008\/01\/gettin-it-goin-without-goin-under.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">incipient instability<\/span><\/a>.  This by no means implies that relationships should remain static or that relationships should not be allowed to decline, that&#8217;s simply a part of evolution.  What it does imply is that changes in the trends of relationships status are particularly powerful indicators of change including growth and incipient instability.  For example what&#8217;s often described as &#8216;momentum&#8217; is an upward trend in the strengthening and addition of relationships.  Or a founder of an organization challenging the direction the venture is taking may be an indicator of a change in the collective agreement, particularly if it was well articulated at the outset (which is rarely the case). Of course, monitoring financial metrics and changes in budget\/plans can also signal incipient instability and by no means should be excluded.  Rather disciplined attention should be focused on the metrics that indicate potential instability.  If the management system is attentive to incipient instability it will be able to minimize its effects or avoid it all together. The other dynamic of effective governance is attention to the <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com2008\/01\/gettin-it-goin-without-goin-under.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">cohesion<\/span><\/a> of the venture itself.  This means that ensuring that both PIE and CV are being attended to and that the dynamic between them is constructive.<\/p>\n<p>There are of course more detailed design aspects to organizing and operating a venture, several key ones of which are described in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Heart-Enterprise-Classic-Beer\/dp\/0471948373\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1199722126&amp;sr=8-1\">Heart of Enterprise<\/a>, but from my experience, research, and through the recent conversations I believe venturing effectively on the frontiers requires the essence of:\n<ul>\n<li>agreement and articulation of the venture (venture profile, relationship map, financial model);<\/li>\n<li>action through intentional co-creative, iterative action planning (process, budgets, time lines); and<\/li>\n<li>governance attentive to cohesion and able to anticipate and preempt incipient instability (future indicating metrics, report card, ability to respond constructively).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Practically, there is significant opportunity in improving upon each of these areas and particularly in the area of relationships with the emergence of new ways and styles of connecting brought forth by virtual communications developments such as social networking technologies. And with that now begins the process of putting this into practice and an open invitation to those who want to embark on this with me.\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 8px;\">Blogged with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flock.com\/blogged-with-flock\" title=\"Flock\" target=\"_new\">Flock<\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 07 Jan 2008 12:18:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 07 Jan 2008 12:18:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 07 Jan 2008 12:18:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":55,"title":"Crowd sourcing in venturing","slug":"crowd-sourcing-in-venturing","markdown":"\nJust saw [this post](http:\/\/davidcrow.ca\/article\/1812\/crowd-powered-capital) tipping me to [VenCorps](http:\/\/www.cambrianhouse.com\/vencorps\/) which seems to be a venture fund using \u2018crowd sourcing\u2019.

Well if one of the biggest chips an investor brings to the game is their social capital, well then how can that capital be better employed in the task of connecting? Going back to the image above, we can see that at minimum it requires a venture to have articulated simple and accessible spaces. I wonder &#8211; how many entrepreneurs and their investors would truly describe the primary spaces of their venture in the same way? How about in your venture or your portfolio? My bet is that&#8217;s strongly correlated to the difference between friction and luck.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Summing up, that leaves us with making bets on:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: bold;\">a team;<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: bold;\">their venturing process; and<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">their spaces (accessible and simply articulated).<\/span> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">And it means bringing our social chips into the game to make the connections the venture truly needs (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">more in a future post<\/span>). <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now that&#8217;s an investment space I&#8217;d bet on.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 12 Feb 2008 17:58:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 12 Feb 2008 17:58:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 12 Feb 2008 17:58:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":64,"title":"Social Tech Training - June 22-24, 2008","slug":"social-tech-training-june-22-24-2008","markdown":"\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[![SocialTech Training](http:\/\/webofchange.com\/sites\/webofchange.com\/files\/images\/stt_badge5.gif)](http:\/\/www.marsdd.com\/socialtechtraining \"SocialTech Training\")<\/div>That\u2019s right, [Social Tech Training](http:\/\/www.marsdd.com\/socialtechtraining) is happening this June in Toronto. \u00a0Here\u2019s the link and a quick blurb. \u00a0Check-it out and sign-up if it catches your eye.

More simply it\u2019s about the process of organizing resources (social, financial, and human capital) toward realizing a certain intent.\n\nIf \u2018open\u2019 really is about[ a new mode of organization](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post75), then it is central to the process of venturing.

I\u2019m writing this now as I head to SoCap08 and looking forward to testing some of these ideas against other emerging models (e.g. Enterpreneur Commons) and amongst the worlds leaders in social venture investment. I\u2019ll follow-up this post with any big insights that emerge and in the meantime I\u2019m interested in any comments about what I\u2019ve started framing below. Feel free to contribute in the comments or email me directly. And of course if you are buliding another model \u2013 feel free to take anything you gain from this and use or remix freely \u2013 just ping me and let me know what you are working on and share alike.*\n\nThe context of venturing is changing and this next generation of ventures requires new models of investment that are more compatible with the new context.\u00a0 There are two main influences which shape the building blocks for a new kind of venture capital.\n\n**Influences on Venturing**\n\n1. **Increasing rate and depth of systems shifts**  \n Markets and industries are coming unhinged (e.g.\u00a0 [financial](http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2008\/10\/12\/markets\/markets_sunday\/?postversion=2008101208), [music,](http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/music\/2008\/feb\/03\/features.review1) [automotive](http:\/\/www.marketoracle.co.uk\/Article5600.html), [airline](http:\/\/www.newser.com\/thread\/1717\/1\/airline-meltdown.html), etc.) and game-changing ventures seem to \u2018come out of nowhere\u2019 (e.g. Craigslist and Google). It means that any venture is subject to drastic, unanticipated changes in their operating context making conventional planning less effective or reliable. Two major drivers of these shifts are changes in the energy and financial markets along with the pervasive adoption of communication technologies and an emergent culture of people comfortably communicating and collaborating with greater numbers of people independent of geography or in-person relationship. These shifts affect everyone, often in unexpected ways and at unexpected times.\n2. **A new mode of organization**  \n A by-product of the underlying shifts above is a new mode of organization that has been exemplified in [open source software](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Open_source \"Open source\"), creative commons, and activism. This mode of organization features increased permeability in the production of the organization, more rapid iteration, and evolution through intentional emergence vs. long-term planning and resource ownership. It also draws more strongly from social and [human capital](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Human_capital \"Human capital\") than it does financial and proprietary intellectual capital.\n\n**Building Blocks for a new kind of Venture Capital**\n\n1. **Focus on outcomes vs. sectors**  \n The frontiers of these changes are at the edges and intersections of sectors \u2013 in places where technologies and trends challenge or circumvent current systems. These frontiers are thriving on the the Increasing complexity in our society and blurring conventional silos and sectors. Focusing directly on desired outcomes opens the seeker to the range of frontiers that influence the possible pathways to achieving the desired outcome versus being constrained to traditionally defined silo.\u00a0 Focusing on specific outcomes also favors smaller, more fluid pools of capital able to evolve along with the frontiers.\n2. **Surf and surface the frontiers**  \n As opposed to \u2018pulling\u2019 deal-flow through conventional channels, the new kind of venture capital needs to be immersed in the frontiers to uncover potentially game changing patterns. Practically this can be accomplished in part by participating in and stimulating public dialogue on these patterns \u2013 such as by blogging and commenting on other blogs relevant to the frontiers. This serves to engage a broader range of participants and fosters the identification, emergence, and advancement of innovative solutions targeting the desired outcome.\n3. **Employ comprehensive capital (financial + social)**  \n With the increasing importance of social and human capital relative to financial and proprietary intellectual capital, the new kind of venture capital must apply the same attention to the management and leverage of [social capital](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_capital \"Social capital\") as they have conventionally applied to financial capital. The value of social capital lies in facilitating connections and trust among the collective social capital networks of those involved \u2013 linking several degrees of connection among all nodes of the collective network. Social capital has long been employed in venture capital by \u2018bringing the rolodex\u2019. It is still however largely untapped and represents a high ROI investment opportunity entirely compatible with financial capital and the needs of the new mode of organization.\n4. **Invest in intentional emergence (systems + engagement)**  \n This is about building a system from which the most effective actions will emerge vs.\u00a0 building a company to execute a pre-determined plan. This accomplished by designing a \u2018viable venture system\u2019 and the building the capacity to continually engage the right resources at the right time to produce the venture. Together these things fuel emergence and enable a venture to rapidly iterate the best solution for an evolving context. For that emergence to be intentional, however, the venture must be firmly grounded in a deep understanding of its purpose, values, theory of change, and have a clearly articulated goal.\n5. **Serve as a conduit for capital**  \n Focusing on outcomes vs. sectors means a shift away from larger investment funds toward highly targeted \u2018expeditions\u2019. It also presents and opportunity for investors to assemble portfolios of target outcomes vs. a portfolio of funds. Actively employing comprehensive capital (financial and social) also means porftolios could reflect social and financial capital invested in individual outcomes and deals while returns would include quantitative metrics and qualitative stories. The viable venture system for this new kind of venture capital must cost-effectively facilitate the engagement of a broad number of participants in flowing financial and social capital among capital sources, targetted outcome explorations, and specific ventures.\n\nOne possbile model for a new kind of venture capital might be a conduit for capital with the following features:\n\n1. **Distributed investment and deal flow \u2013 \u201cOutcome Expeditions\u201d**  \n Engage individuals to conduct \u2018outcome expeditions\u2019****\u2013 . These people would be expected to blog and comment on others blogs on the frontiers related to specific outcomes.\u00a0 They would also be able to make small investments in ventures (e.g <$25k\/investment and >3 investments\/yr.) that would meaningfully improve the venture\u2019s system or advance key stakeholder engagement. This would be done with minimal paperwork and would help draw deal-flow and attention on the frontiers. Investees would then be listed in a \u2018venture commons\u2019 as a \u2018frontier venture\u2019.\n2. **Personal venture and outcome portfolios**  \n Enable investors to invest social and financial capital directly in either frontier ventures (as deals arise) and \u2018outcome expeditions\u2019. Their portfolio would track social and financial capital invested as well as quantitative and qualitative returns generated. Furthermore, the portfolios also become a gateway to the frontiers of interest for them, feeding the blog posts, comments and other information generated in the outcome expeditions and investee ventures. Investors would have to commit a minimum amount of social and financial capital on an annual basis to participate in the platform but would be free to allocate those funds as they saw fit over the year.\n3. **Active employment of social capital**  \n Tracking social capital involves tracking contributions and connections made for expeditions and ventures either directly or indirectly. Ventures and expedition leaders are expected to report on returns realized from specific social capital investments where value was generated. These will be captured as best as possible in quantitative and qualitative measures. While likely best implemented initially on a voluntary basis, this could evolve to contractual over time including pre-determined participation in financial returns generated from social capital investments.\n\n**Walking the Talk**\n\nInvesting on the frontiers and encouraging a new mode of organization means that the new kind of venture capital should itself operate in that new mode. This means being increasingly permeable in the production of the organization, iterating rapidly, and being intentionally emergent.\u00a0 More specifically this means challenging some conventional barriers such as sharing of information working from a starting premise that all should be shared vs. all is proprietary.

I&#8217;m writing this now as I head to SoCap08 and looking forward to testing some of these ideas against other emerging models (e.g. Enterpreneur Commons) and amongst the worlds leaders in social venture investment. I&#8217;ll follow-up this post with any big insights that emerge and in the meantime I&#8217;m interested in any comments about what I&#8217;ve started framing below. Feel free to contribute in the comments or email me directly. And of course if you are buliding another model &#8211; feel free to take anything you gain from this and use or remix freely &#8211; just ping me and let me know what you are working on and share alike.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The context of venturing is changing and this next generation of ventures requires new models of investment that are more compatible with the new context.\u00a0 There are two main influences which shape the building blocks for a new kind of venture capital.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Influences on Venturing<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increasing rate and depth of systems shifts<\/strong><br \/>\nMarkets and industries are coming unhinged (e.g.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2008\/10\/12\/markets\/markets_sunday\/?postversion=2008101208\">financial<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/music\/2008\/feb\/03\/features.review1\">music,<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketoracle.co.uk\/Article5600.html\">automotive<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newser.com\/thread\/1717\/1\/airline-meltdown.html\">airline<\/a>, etc.) and game-changing ventures seem to &#8216;come out of nowhere&#8217; (e.g. Craigslist and Google). It means that any venture is subject to drastic, unanticipated changes in their operating context making conventional planning less effective or reliable. Two major drivers of these shifts are changes in the energy and financial markets along with the pervasive adoption of communication technologies and an emergent culture of people comfortably communicating and collaborating with greater numbers of people independent of geography or in-person relationship. These shifts affect everyone, often in unexpected ways and at unexpected times.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A new mode of organization<\/strong><br \/>\nA by-product of the underlying shifts above is a new mode of organization that has been exemplified in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Open source\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Open_source\">open source software<\/a>, creative commons, and activism. This mode of organization features increased permeability in the production of the organization, more rapid iteration, and evolution through intentional emergence vs. long-term planning and resource ownership. It also draws more strongly from social and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Human capital\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Human_capital\">human capital<\/a> than it does financial and proprietary intellectual capital.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Building Blocks for a new kind of Venture Capital<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Focus on outcomes vs. sectors<\/strong><br \/>\nThe frontiers of these changes are at the edges and intersections of sectors &#8211; in places where technologies and trends challenge or circumvent current systems. These frontiers are thriving on the the Increasing complexity in our society and blurring conventional silos and sectors. Focusing directly on desired outcomes opens the seeker to the range of frontiers that influence the possible pathways to achieving the desired outcome versus being constrained to traditionally defined silo.\u00a0 Focusing on specific outcomes also favors smaller, more fluid pools of capital able to evolve along with the frontiers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Surf and surface the frontiers<\/strong><br \/>\nAs opposed to &#8216;pulling&#8217; deal-flow through conventional channels, the new kind of venture capital needs to be immersed in the frontiers to uncover potentially game changing patterns. Practically this can be accomplished in part by participating in and stimulating public dialogue on these patterns &#8211; such as by blogging and commenting on other blogs relevant to the frontiers. This serves to engage a broader range of participants and fosters the identification, emergence, and advancement of innovative solutions targeting the desired outcome.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Employ comprehensive capital (financial + social)<\/strong><br \/>\nWith the increasing importance of social and human capital relative to financial and proprietary intellectual capital, the new kind of venture capital must apply the same attention to the management and leverage of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Social capital\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_capital\">social capital<\/a> as they have conventionally applied to financial capital. The value of social capital lies in facilitating connections and trust among the collective social capital networks of those involved &#8211; linking several degrees of connection among all nodes of the collective network. Social capital has long been employed in venture capital by &#8216;bringing the rolodex&#8217;. It is still however largely untapped and represents a high ROI investment opportunity entirely compatible with financial capital and the needs of the new mode of organization.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Invest in intentional emergence (systems + engagement)<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is about building a system from which the most effective actions will emerge vs.\u00a0 building a company to execute a pre-determined plan. This accomplished by designing a &#8216;viable venture system&#8217; and the building the capacity to continually engage the right resources at the right time to produce the venture. Together these things fuel emergence and enable a venture to rapidly iterate the best solution for an evolving context. For that emergence to be intentional, however, the venture must be firmly grounded in a deep understanding of its purpose, values, theory of change, and have a clearly articulated goal.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Serve as a conduit for capital<\/strong><br \/>\nFocusing on outcomes vs. sectors means a shift away from larger investment funds toward highly targeted &#8216;expeditions&#8217;. It also presents and opportunity for investors to assemble portfolios of target outcomes vs. a portfolio of funds. Actively employing comprehensive capital (financial and social) also means porftolios could reflect social and financial capital invested in individual outcomes and deals while returns would include quantitative metrics and qualitative stories. The viable venture system for this new kind of venture capital must cost-effectively facilitate the engagement of a broad number of participants in flowing financial and social capital among capital sources, targetted outcome explorations, and specific ventures.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>One possbile model for a new kind of venture capital might be a conduit for capital with the following features:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Distributed investment and deal flow &#8211; &#8220;Outcome Expeditions&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\nEngage individuals to conduct &#8216;outcome expeditions&#8217;<strong> <\/strong>&#8211; . These people would be expected to blog and comment on others blogs on the frontiers related to specific outcomes.\u00a0 They would also be able to make small investments in ventures (e.g &lt;$25k\/investment and &gt;3 investments\/yr.) that would meaningfully improve the venture&#8217;s system or advance key stakeholder engagement. This would be done with minimal paperwork and would help draw deal-flow and attention on the frontiers. Investees would then be listed in a &#8216;venture commons&#8217; as a &#8216;frontier venture&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Personal venture and outcome portfolios<\/strong><br \/>\nEnable investors to invest social and financial capital directly in either frontier ventures (as deals arise) and &#8216;outcome expeditions&#8217;. Their portfolio would track social and financial capital invested as well as quantitative and qualitative returns generated. Furthermore, the portfolios also become a gateway to the frontiers of interest for them, feeding the blog posts, comments and other information generated in the outcome expeditions and investee ventures. Investors would have to commit a minimum amount of social and financial capital on an annual basis to participate in the platform but would be free to allocate those funds as they saw fit over the year.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Active employment of social capital<\/strong><br \/>\nTracking social capital involves tracking contributions and connections made for expeditions and ventures either directly or indirectly. Ventures and expedition leaders are expected to report on returns realized from specific social capital investments where value was generated. These will be captured as best as possible in quantitative and qualitative measures. While likely best implemented initially on a voluntary basis, this could evolve to contractual over time including pre-determined participation in financial returns generated from social capital investments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Walking the Talk<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Investing on the frontiers and encouraging a new mode of organization means that the new kind of venture capital should itself operate in that new mode. This means being increasingly permeable in the production of the organization, iterating rapidly, and being intentionally emergent.\u00a0 More specifically this means challenging some conventional barriers such as sharing of information working from a starting premise that all should be shared vs. all is proprietary. It also encourages distributed descision making and designing a system for investment to happen vs. buildng a fund to invest. The use of wikis, blogging, participating in public discourse and the information commons is a simple cornerstone of this type of organization as evidenced in the opensource and activism communities. Additionally, skills of community building and management including the effective employment of advanced communication and collaboration tools are necessary core competencies.<\/p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Zemified by Zemanta\" href=\"http:\/\/reblog.zemanta.com\/zemified\/2502c48a-a2eb-4192-be92-3f1c45d68166\/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: medium none; float: right;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.zemanta.com\/reblog_e.png?x-id=2502c48a-a2eb-4192-be92-3f1c45d68166\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 15:07:09 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 15:07:09 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 15:07:09 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":263,"title":"SoCap08 - Alive online","slug":"socap08-alive-online","markdown":"\n<div class=\"thumbnail\">[![Social Capital Markets Model](http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20081014-c68padjjcg4tsjctsf4x9tqgjp.preview.jpg)](http:\/\/skitch.com\/igniter\/2wgq\/social-capital-markets-model)<span style=\"font-size: 10px; font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; color: #808080;\"><\/span>My first impression of [SoCap08](http:\/\/socialcapitalmarkets.net) have as much to do with the excellence of the physical event as they do with the virtualization of it.<\/div>First the physical event.

It was a great event with a lot of great output coming out already.\n\n![](http:\/\/img.skitch.com\/20081022-c1scqwf7f243u1qkjnemykkf91.jpg \"SoCap in the Crisis\")For me it affirmed my view that Social Capital Markets are part of the evolution of the financial markets as a whole and are catalyzed by the capital needs of the innovations that are working to address the increasing social and environmental challenges we face. The timing of the event \u2013 at the depths of this financial crisis \u2013 and the last-minute surge in registrations to over 600 certainly contributed to that. Coming into the event some were thinking that the crisis might have people running for the hills.

The following features are the key enablers:\n\n- Default public on account setup (tweets will be public)\n- 140 character limitation\n- Tagging (@ and #)\n- Permission-less follow (you don\u2019t need permission to \u2018follow\u2019 someone)\n- SMS compatibility (tweet from your mobile phone)\n- \u2018Open\u2019 API (anyone can build on top of Twitter)\n\n2. This seems to nuture\/result in:\n\n- **Unmatched discovery** because of the public nature, short snippets, and tagability (@, #, url \u2013 and now $, ^, !) that generate high link density. No matter your interests you can find people and threads on twitter that will also lead you to new interests and places.\n- **Uncontrollable** as there is no structure beyond voluntary tagging. Can\u2019t even be sure a person that is following you will see your tweet. This is why \u2018marketing\u2019 fails spectacularly in Twitter.\n- **Humbling and leveling.** Anyone can follow anyone and \u2018reply\u2019 to them by tagging their handle. Billionaires and others who are most inaccessible may respond to an unknown person on twitter. And just because you are a billionaire, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that people will be interested in what you have to say. On twitter a big part of you is your last 20 tweets.\n- **Authenticity and rapid trust building.** The 140 character limitation seems to promote a brevity and frequency that leads to a higher degree of authenticity. My experience has been that my experience of meeting people in real-life is highly correlated to my experience of them on Twitter. I think it must take too much energy to be something other than who you are on Twitter if you use it with any frequency.\n- **Collectively iterative.** Again because of the brevity and uncontrollability things tend to iterate quickly among multiple people if they gain any momentum. Things only gain momentum when there is collective iteration.\n- **Speedy and Spontaneous.** From the collective iteration and default to public, if something takes hold it can spread uncontrollably aournd the world. It is unknown where it will go and can die as quickly as it started.\n- **Loving and constructive. **There are only so many ways to complain and criticize through 140 characters. What\u2019s more, noone has to respond, and you can\u2019t be sure anyone is even reading. What gets rewarded is intersting information, links, and action. Those are the things that people will invest their own 140 characters in.\n\n3. This isn\u2019t utopia, it just encourages our better parts:\n\n- Human nature will always show through\n- But, because of the key enablers it\u2019s more likely to be the better parts of our nature.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your comments, or get links to any other posts, reserachers that are exploring this topic. And if you are compelled enough to post, please link back here too. The more we can feed into the research engines that are interested in this the more it will help us all.\n\nUPDATE: Btw\u2026 there was an interesting [Twitter thread](http:\/\/search.twitter.com\/search?q=%23twinnovation) on this a week or so ago.\n\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\">[![Reblog this post [with Zemanta]](http:\/\/img.zemanta.com\/reblog_c.png?x-id=af743ca9-ca9d-4619-8dd2-bc0a939bd8f9)](http:\/\/reblog.zemanta.com\/zemified\/af743ca9-ca9d-4619-8dd2-bc0a939bd8f9\/ \"Zemified by Zemanta\")<\/div>\n","html":"<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<div>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 220px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/company\/twitter\"><img title=\"Image representing Twitter as depicted in Crun...\" src=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/assets\/images\/resized\/0000\/2755\/2755v2-max-450x450.png\" alt=\"Image representing Twitter as depicted in Crun...\" width=\"210\" height=\"49\" \/><\/a><\/dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd zemanta-img-attribution\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">Image via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\">CrunchBase<\/a><\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Whether you love it, hate it or otherwise, there is something unique enabled through <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\">Twitter<\/a>.

It\u2019s easy to do, nothing more than typing a short message, and can be done from anywhere via computer or mobile phone. **This makes it real.**<\/span>\n\n<span>The result is streams of succinct, interest-driven messages that create relevant, real-time context around every account, topic, and object they reference\u2026 which effectively means anything and everything. With that comes an increasing expectation that the web will orient itself around each person, topic, or object based on it\u2019s history and real-time context. Already for me, I\u00a0 follow fewer blogs, spend less time in any single site, and instead find more of what\u2019s interesting to me *coming to me* through real-time messages from the people and topical threads I follow.** This reorientation**<\/span><span>** is what is changing the web.  \n**<\/span>\n\n<span>To me it\u2019s clear that we are entering into the biggest transformation of the use and form of the web since it\u2019s creation. This is not an incremental improvement but rather a fundamental evolution that requires a whole new set of applications, services and ways of interacting.  \n<\/span>\n\n<span>**Cool.\u00a0 So now what? **For me, there are 2 things.\u00a0 First, for the real-time web to reach its full potential we need a<\/span><span> neutral, platform-independent application infrastructure and public dataset. Second, this will be the fastest evolution we\u2019ve ever encountered and with that comes an unprecedented opportunity to seed a whole new wave game-changing ventures.<\/span>\n\n**A neutral, platform-independent application infrastructure and public dataset.  \n**<span>Anyone who has built something on the Twitter API knows of the challenges and limitations. Processing real-time public micro-messaging data is a big challenge and one that is only going to get harder as more people and more services publish public micro-messages. This challenge could seriously stunt the growth of the real-time web and lead to a fractured future. What it calls for instead is a neutral, <\/span><span>platform-independent foundation that<\/span><span> hosts and provides the real-time dataset and a robust and reliable application infrastructure to build upon. Such an approach is also more compatible with the essence of the real-time web which is fundamentally a public resource created by people for public consumption. <\/span><span>**This is what we are working on through SVC.**<\/span>\n\n**Seeding a whole new wave of game-changing ventures.**<span>  \n It\u2019s just beginning. [Betaworks investments](http:\/\/static.betaworks.com\/work\/index.html) for example shape an early ecosystem of some of the most relevant ventures in this area and [Collecta](http:\/\/luckyrobot.com\/2009\/03\/24\/gerry-campbell-named-ceo-of-collectacom-realtime-web-search\/) and maybe [<span class=\"zem_slink\">Ginx<\/span>](http:\/\/ginx.com\/help\/about) are two ventures that I think are getting right to the core of the real-time web. It\u2019s also never been easier to launch a web service and with new application infrastructures it will only get easier. The key challenge, aside from the infrastructure issue, is being first to market\u00a0 with applications that work with how the real-time web really works.

With that comes an increasing expectation that the web will orient itself around each person, topic, or object based on it&#8217;s history and real-time context. Already for me, I\u00a0 follow fewer blogs, spend less time in any single site, and instead find more of what\u2019s interesting to me <em>coming to me<\/em> through real-time messages from the people and topical threads I follow.<strong> This reorientation<\/strong><\/span><span><strong> is what is changing the web.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To me it\u2019s clear that we are entering into the biggest transformation of the use and form of the web since it\u2019s creation.

Processing real-time public micro-messaging data is a big challenge and one that is only going to get harder as more people and more services publish public micro-messages.

What it calls for instead is a neutral, <\/span><span>platform-independent foundation that<\/span><span> hosts and provides the real-time dataset and a robust and reliable application infrastructure to build upon.

Well I think it\u2019s time to do it again for this thing called public micro-messaging. Here\u2019s why.\n\nWith [3000% year over year growth](http:\/\/blog.comscore.com\/2009\/05\/twitter_traffic_quadruples.html), it\u2019s no question that [Twitter](http:\/\/twitter.com \"Twitter\") is here to stay. It\u2019s also increasingly clear that what\u2019s behind the phenomenon is something bigger\u2026 as [Om Malik](http:\/\/www.gigaom.com \"Om Malik\") observed back on [April 14th, 2009](http:\/\/omis.me\/2009\/04\/14\/what-twitter-broadband-internet-mean-to-me\/):\n\n> \u201cTwitter is just the beginning of this real-time internet  \n>  \u2013 the simplest manifestation of this long term trend \u2013  \n>  that spells the end of communications and start of an interaction society.\u201d\n\n**What\u2019s going on here is the emergence of a new medium based on the public micro-message (PMM) \u2013 *the most accessible, interactive public medium in our history. ***\n\nSounds pretty nifty, doesn\u2019t it? Well, here\u2019s the catch. Every message posted is a public object that may be called upon at any time. Combined with the rapid increase in number of users, the number of posts per user, and the number of services publishing PMMs, PMM services and application developers face a massive data processing challenge. Already, Twitter struggles to provide a stable application infrastructure and user experience despite [prominent venture capital backing](http:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5gY0bFqgqeJm2LvNIHfekTCxar2ww) and technical investment.\n\nThis is just the beginning. [Dave Winer](http:\/\/www.scripting.com\/ \"Dave Winer\") puts forward a good case of [why there will be many more Twitters](http:\/\/www.scripting.com\/stories\/2009\/04\/25\/whyThereWillBeManyTwitters.html) \u2013 and Dave\u2019s a smart guy, so what happens when we have 10 more services and 100 times the activity? Not only does the data processing challenge grow but we run headfirst into issues of disconnected silos of public micro-messages and limited interoperability. Finally, the total reach of the medium is directly affected by global [SMS](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Short_message_service \"Short message service\") interoperability which is currently a costly and cumbersome country by country issue.\n\nUnaddressed, these issues will undoubtedly limit the value that can be realized from this medium. And that helps no one. So now what? [](http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/110968319\/on-the-one-hand-the-member-financial-institutions)\n\n**It\u2019s time to [pull a VISA.](http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/110968319\/on-the-one-hand-the-member-financial-institutions)**\n\nResponding to these challenges requires a universal system, standards, and SMS gateway for public micro-messages \u2013 in other words a network-grade infrastructure. The core of this system could operate as a layer below Twitter acting as a scalable, interoperable PMM processing infrastructure connecting PMM services and facilitating real-time access to an aggregated PMM data-set. It could operate as an infrastructure to PMM services upon which they can build robust and scalable services and enable an ecosystem of applications. In my view it would have to: enable a vibrant ecosystem of PMM services and applications, provide unrestricted access to the aggregated PMM data-set, ensure authors have access to and control over their prior messages, be scalable to the global population, and be optimized for public bene\ufb01t.\n\nThis might sound ambitions but I believe it entirely possible. Whether through leveraging some existing technologies like [XMPP](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol \"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol\"), [Hadoop](http:\/\/hadoop.apache.org\/), and [Laconi.ca](http:\/\/laconi.ca) or attracting some of the worlds top developers from the telecom or financial exchange markets to create a new infrastructure \u2013 it is a shared, soluble problem that unlocks enormous opportunity.\n\n**So what\u2019s next? **\n\nI\u2019ve been making some forays into making this happen and think it\u2019s something that can be tackled by scoping and exploring the 3 components of the solution (system, standards, SMS gateway) and getting the key players in a room together to create the thing they all need to make the most of the medium. Players like Twitter, Laconi.ca, [Google](http:\/\/google.com \"Google\"), [<span class=\"zem_slink\">World Wide Web Foundation<\/span>](http:\/\/webfoundation.org), and the mobile industry and others have a very real interest in seeing this happen. How could it not be worth giving it a try?\n\nAnd just think, if we do this, Twitter could finally retire their faithful Fail Whale. I for one would like to set it free.

Well I think it&#8217;s time to do it again for this thing called public micro-messaging. Here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.comscore.com\/2009\/05\/twitter_traffic_quadruples.html\">3000% year over year growth<\/a>, it&#8217;s no question that <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\">Twitter<\/a> is here to stay. It&#8217;s also increasingly clear that what&#8217;s behind the phenomenon is something bigger&#8230; as <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Om Malik\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gigaom.com\">Om Malik<\/a> observed back on <a href=\"http:\/\/omis.me\/2009\/04\/14\/what-twitter-broadband-internet-mean-to-me\/\">April 14th, 2009<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cTwitter is just the beginning of this real-time internet<br \/>\n&#8211; the simplest manifestation of this long term trend &#8211;<br \/>\nthat spells the end of communications and start of an interaction society.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s going on here is the emergence of a new medium based on the public micro-message (PMM) &#8211; <em>the most accessible, interactive public medium in our history. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sounds pretty nifty, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, here&#8217;s the catch. Every message posted is a public object that may be called upon at any time. Combined with the rapid increase in number of users, the number of posts per user, and the number of services publishing PMMs, PMM services and application developers face a massive data processing challenge.  Already, Twitter struggles to provide a stable application infrastructure and user experience despite <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5gY0bFqgqeJm2LvNIHfekTCxar2ww\">prominent venture capital backing<\/a> and technical investment.<\/p>\n<p>This is just the beginning. <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dave Winer\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scripting.com\/\">Dave Winer<\/a> puts forward a good case of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scripting.com\/stories\/2009\/04\/25\/whyThereWillBeManyTwitters.html\">why there will be many more Twitters<\/a> &#8211; and Dave&#8217;s a smart guy, so what happens when we have 10 more services and 100 times the activity? Not only does the data processing challenge grow but we run headfirst into issues of disconnected silos of public micro-messages and limited interoperability. Finally, the total reach of the medium is directly affected by global <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Short message service\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Short_message_service\">SMS<\/a> interoperability which is currently a costly and cumbersome country by country issue.<\/p>\n<p>Unaddressed, these issues will undoubtedly limit the value that can be realized from this medium. And that helps no one. So now what?   <a href=\"http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/110968319\/on-the-one-hand-the-member-financial-institutions\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s time to <a href=\"http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/110968319\/on-the-one-hand-the-member-financial-institutions\">pull a VISA.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Responding to these challenges requires a universal system, standards, and SMS gateway for public micro-messages &#8211; in other words a network-grade infrastructure. The core of this system could operate as a layer below Twitter acting as a scalable, interoperable PMM processing infrastructure connecting PMM services and facilitating real-time access to an aggregated PMM data-set. It could operate as an infrastructure to PMM services upon which they can build robust and scalable services and enable an ecosystem of applications. In my view it would have to: enable a vibrant ecosystem of PMM services and applications, provide unrestricted access to the aggregated PMM data-set, ensure authors have access to and control over their prior messages, be scalable to the global population, and be optimized for public bene\ufb01t.<\/p>\n<p>This might sound ambitions but I believe it entirely possible. Whether through leveraging some existing technologies like <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol\">XMPP<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/hadoop.apache.org\/\">Hadoop<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/laconi.ca\">Laconi.ca<\/a> or attracting some of the worlds top developers from the telecom or financial exchange markets to create a new infrastructure &#8211; it is a shared, soluble problem that unlocks enormous opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what&#8217;s next? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been making some forays into making this happen and think it&#8217;s something that can be tackled by scoping and exploring the 3 components of the solution (system, standards, SMS gateway) and getting the key players in a room together to create the thing they all need to make the most of the medium. Players like Twitter, Laconi.ca, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/google.com\">Google<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/webfoundation.org\"><span class=\"zem_slink\">World Wide Web Foundation<\/span><\/a>, and the mobile industry and others have a very real interest in seeing this happen. How could it not be worth giving it a try?<\/p>\n<p>And just think, if we do this, Twitter could finally retire their faithful Fail Whale. I for one would like to set it free.

And every destination seems to want us to have a conversation there. Well that\u2019s not really working either because there are just too many places asking us for conversation.\n\n[Twitter](http:\/\/twitter.com) however seems to be changing the game \u2013 for the first time enabling many to actually reduce the number of sources they monitor for information and the number of destinations they post at. And it\u2019s also a universal place to have a conversation because the conversation doesn\u2019t happen in a destination, it happens in public, wherever people happen to be.\n\nCouple this with a movement to open data sets, like the [Social Actions API](http:\/\/www.socialactions.com\/developers), and I believe we are beginning to see a remediation of the great disintermediator that is the web.\n\nSticking with \u2018social actions\u2019 for a minute, here\u2019s what I\u2019d love to see.\n\n1. A data set of things I can do to make a positive social impact or help those trying to do the same. This is an aggregation of the stuff I can actually do on all these destinations.\n2. Associate every action with a micro-url that is branded to indicate it the url links to a social action. Urls are the universal element of the web. A branded url gives me an idea of what to expect is behind that link.\n3. When I click on a that micro-url take me to the source, and offer up the context I need to evaluate the action through a header bar in the page itself (like [hootsuite](http:\/\/hootsuite.com) etc.). What I want to know are things like what is being said about the link generally, by my friends, and what it is related to. Give me the context quickly but do it in a way that doesn\u2019t take me away from the source.\n4. For the sources of actions, don\u2019t make me have to come to your site to contribute to the discussion. Enable the discussion in the community (e.g. org, issue, and action related threads) and showcase that discussion on your site around the action or issue you are engaging on.\n\nSo for example, here\u2019s what could have happened with #iranelections.\n\nAs the issue showed up, organizations for the whom the topic was mission relevant could have started tweeting, and spawned a widget on their site that displayed a filtered stream of #iranelection \u2013 posts from their prefered sources. If they wanted to spawn a related conversation they could then have created a new hashtag (or #iranelections.sub or !sub \u2013 or some other hash tag variant). If they had specific actions related to the cause they could have put them in the open data set and let them out in the #iranelection stream under a micro-url that is recognized as a social action link whether the organization was known or not. Someone following #iranelections could then have concentrated on actionable items coming through the stream, clicked on any that seemed interesting, and immediately been taken to where they can do something to make a difference with the context necessary to decide, quickly, if they wanted to take action.\n\nBottom-line, this would help surface actionable responses to any issue, make it easier for people to vet those actions on the fly, and increase speed and depth of actions taken on any issue. Interestingly, the pieces are mostly there, we just haven\u2019t connected them. I love the idea of [act.ly](http:\/\/act.ly\/) or [do.gd](http:\/\/do.gd\/) as micro-urls for social action. [SocialActions](http:\/\/socialactions.com) and more recently [AllforGood](http:\/\/allforgood.org) have launched social action datasets and API\u2019s. And finally some [SocialActions](http:\/\/socialactions.com) developers have created some base code for a header bar. Even the engines to filter, embed, and even enable new hashtags exists and what doesn\u2019t isn\u2019t particularly hard to create.\n\nIf we got this right, I\u2019d love to see how it could help things happen both in response to the crises that flare and the core issues that persist.\n\nThink this would work? Have ideas to make it better? Doing something about it? Leave a note in comments. Maybe there\u2019s a community out there that can stitch this together.\n\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\">[![Reblog this post [with Zemanta]](http:\/\/img.zemanta.com\/reblog_c.png?x-id=6a24d48f-a0d3-4636-8566-71afbfff3f53)](http:\/\/reblog.zemanta.com\/zemified\/6a24d48f-a0d3-4636-8566-71afbfff3f53\/ \"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\")<span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http:\/\/static.zemanta.com\/readside\/loader.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"><\/script><\/span><\/div>\n","html":"<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<figure style=\"width: 240px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image:10mm-aggregate.jpg\"><img class=\" \" title=\"10mm graded crushed rock or aggregate, for use...\" src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/e\/e6\/10mm-aggregate.jpg\/300px-10mm-aggregate.jpg\" alt=\"10mm graded crushed rock or aggregate, for use...\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve become inundated with destinations, places to go, placess to post, places to read and place to make change&#8230; and the effort of aggregators seem largely only to have added another destination.

This is an aggregation of the stuff I can actually do on all these destinations.<\/li>\n<li>Associate every action with a micro-url that is branded to indicate it the url links to a social action. Urls are the universal element of the web. A branded url gives me an idea of what to expect is behind that link.<\/li>\n<li>When I click on a that micro-url take me to the source, and offer up the context I need to evaluate the action through a header bar in the page itself (like <a href=\"http:\/\/hootsuite.com\">hootsuite<\/a> etc.). What I want to know are things like what is being said about the link generally, by my friends, and what it is related to. Give me the context quickly but do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t take me away from the source.<\/li>\n<li>For the sources of actions, don&#8217;t make me have to come to your site to contribute to the discussion. Enable the discussion in the community (e.g. org, issue, and action related threads) and showcase that discussion on your site around the action or issue you are engaging on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So for example, here&#8217;s what could have happened with #iranelections.<\/p>\n<p>As the issue showed up, organizations for the whom the topic was mission relevant could have started tweeting, and spawned a widget on their site that displayed a filtered stream of #iranelection &#8211; posts from their prefered sources. If they wanted to spawn a related conversation they could then have created a new hashtag (or #iranelections.sub or !sub &#8211; or some other hash tag variant). If they had specific actions related to the cause they could have put them in the open data set and let them out in the #iranelection stream under a micro-url that is recognized as a social action link whether the organization was known or not. Someone following #iranelections could then have concentrated on actionable items coming through the stream, clicked on any that seemed interesting, and immediately been taken to where they can do something to make a difference with the context necessary to decide, quickly, if they wanted to take action.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom-line, this would help surface actionable responses to any issue, make it easier for people to vet those actions on the fly, and increase speed and depth of actions taken on any issue. Interestingly, the pieces are mostly there, we just haven&#8217;t connected them. I love the idea of <a href=\"http:\/\/act.ly\/\" target=\"_blank\">act.ly<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/do.gd\/\" target=\"_blank\">do.gd<\/a> as micro-urls for social action. <a href=\"http:\/\/socialactions.com\">SocialActions<\/a> and more recently <a href=\"http:\/\/allforgood.org\">AllforGood<\/a> have launched social action datasets and API&#8217;s. And finally some <a href=\"http:\/\/socialactions.com\">SocialActions<\/a> developers have created some base code for a header bar. Even the engines to filter, embed, and even enable new hashtags exists and what doesn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t particularly hard to create.<\/p>\n<p>If we got this right, I&#8217;d love to see how it could help things happen both in response to the crises that flare and the core issues that persist.<\/p>\n<p>Think this would work? Have ideas to make it better? Doing something about it? Leave a note in comments. Maybe there&#8217;s a community out there that can stitch this together.<\/p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http:\/\/reblog.zemanta.com\/zemified\/6a24d48f-a0d3-4636-8566-71afbfff3f53\/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.zemanta.com\/reblog_c.png?x-id=6a24d48f-a0d3-4636-8566-71afbfff3f53\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" \/><\/a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http:\/\/static.zemanta.com\/readside\/loader.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"><\/script><\/span><\/div>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 11:11:25 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 11:11:25 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 11:11:25 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":458,"title":"Framing our future: SoCap09","slug":"framing-our-future-socap09","markdown":"\n[![socap09_150px_w](http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/lewwwk\/image\/upload\/v1432924035\/socap09_150px_w_mbnpwq.gif \"socap09_150px_w\")](http:\/\/socialcapitalmarkets.net)I\u2019m looking forward to this year\u2019s [Social Capital Markets conference](http:\/\/socialcapitalmarkets.net).

Micro is about sms \u2013 the reach of sms means every mobile phone on the planet \u2013 or about 4 billion potential contributors.

Impact is an outcome.**  \n Investment is a choice. A choice for a reason. A choice of reason.\n\n** Reason is not static. Reason evolves. **  \n Teach a person to fish, they fish. Pond gets over-fished, they go hungry. Every system is part of other systems. Every action affects others. Nothing stays the same.\n\n** Impact is easy. Reason is hard **  \n Impact is a measure. Reason is understanding. As systems collapse and collide, impact becomes erratic and un-predictable. Reason responds, metrics reset, action adapts.\n\nImpact is \u201cwhat happened\u201d. Reason is \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d.\n\n** Beyond metrics to sensing and foresight **  \n Our work creates change, in times of increasing change. Our pace of success depends on our ability to 1) sense the evolution of now, and 2) foresee where the dynamics lead.\n\nSensing \u201cnow\u201d demands a new set of filters and criteria. Today, in a world deluged by data (which change every day), relevancy matters more than volume, frequency and timeliness. Curation counts.\n\nForesight clarifies \u201cnext\u201d. It acknowledges that the future is unknown but leverages fit, character, and ability to absorb new opportunities. It seeks to understand a kind of gravity. These elements attract opportunity. Knowing their gravity and reconciling with emerging demands enables analytical understanding of what might come next.\n\n** We live in a fulcrum. **  \n Social issues are surging in the face of a flagging economy. We are global. Our systems have failed. We haven\u2019t yet chosen new ones. A window is open. The world is begging.\n\n**Grasping the potential of this moment depends on four key outcomes:**\n\n- **Wake the senses:** Define, quantify, and validate are just the beginning. Up the ante. Sensing now. Map change. Feed foresight.\n- **Create clarity:** Honor complexity, obliterate complication. Let things be inter-connected but do not confuse.

Impact is an outcome.<\/strong><br \/>\nInvestment is a choice. A choice for a reason. A choice of reason.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Reason is not static. Reason evolves. <\/strong><br \/>\nTeach a person to fish, they fish. Pond gets over-fished, they go hungry. Every system is part of other systems. Every action affects others. Nothing stays the same.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Impact is easy. Reason is hard <\/strong><br \/>\nImpact is a measure. Reason is understanding. As systems collapse and collide, impact becomes erratic and un-predictable. Reason responds, metrics reset, action adapts.<\/p>\n<p>Impact is &#8220;what happened&#8221;. Reason is &#8220;what&#8217;s next&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Beyond metrics to sensing and foresight <\/strong><br \/>\nOur work creates change, in times of increasing change. Our pace of success depends on our ability to 1) sense the evolution of now, and 2) foresee where the dynamics lead.<\/p>\n<p>Sensing \u201cnow\u201d demands a new set of filters and criteria. Today, in a world deluged by data (which change every day), relevancy matters more than volume, frequency and timeliness. Curation counts.<\/p>\n<p>Foresight clarifies \u201cnext\u201d. It acknowledges that the future is unknown but leverages fit, character, and ability to absorb new opportunities. It seeks to understand a kind of gravity. These elements attract opportunity. Knowing their gravity and reconciling with emerging demands enables analytical understanding of what might come next.<\/p>\n<p><strong> We live in a fulcrum. <\/strong><br \/>\nSocial issues are surging in the face of a flagging economy. We are global. Our systems have failed. We haven\u2019t yet chosen new ones. A window is open. The world is begging.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Grasping the potential of this moment depends on four key outcomes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wake the senses:<\/strong> Define, quantify, and validate are just the beginning. Up the ante. Sensing now. Map change. Feed foresight.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create clarity:<\/strong> Honor complexity, obliterate complication. Let things be inter-connected but do not confuse. Invest simply, with reason.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quicken the pace:<\/strong> Change is accelerating. Change is changing. Our ability to sense and respond needs to keep up.

Within the context of the goals of today, what are some of the trends you see developing in the mico-messaging\/social change spaces? As a group decide on what you think is the most significant trend.\n2. With your new group share what your group felt was the most important\/significant trend. As a group, discuss your thoughts on what these trends \u00a0mean for the future, where are we headed, what becomes possible?\n3. With the future possibilities in mind, discuss what technology roadblocks exist today that need to be remedied\/overcome to achieve this future vision.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 350px;\">[![Animated...](http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3486\/4046257745_4c566ac83a.jpg \"WorldCafe @ #cmToronto\")](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/michaellewkowitz\/sets\/72157622542758987\/)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Animated...<\/figcaption><\/figure>The experience was described as \u201ceerie\u201d, \u201camazing\u201d, and \u201cunexpected\u201d due to the high degree of similarity among participants\u2019 answers and observations in each of the questions. A real sense of community began to form through this process which could have easily been extended from the 5 minutes per question allocated.\n\nThe hacklab began shortly after noon and was introduced by James Walker as an opportunity to work on infrastructure, applications, or even have extended conversations. The group identified four topics:\n\n1. [Status.net](http:\/\/Status.net), [Open Micro Blogging](http:\/\/openmicroblogging.org)\n2. Relevant Inbox\n3. Hashtag Directories\n4. Local Political Engagement\n\nDevelopment commenced on the \u201cStatus.net\/Open Micro Blogging\u201d and \u201cLocal Political Engagement\u201d topics\u00a0while a lively conversation emerged around the role ChangeMedium can play in supporting the research community.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 500px;\">[![Making...](http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2442\/4056117997_d8b764f891.jpg \"Hacking @ #cmToronto\")](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/michaellewkowitz\/sets\/72157622542758987\/)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Making...<\/figcaption><\/figure>In reflection a number of observations have surfaced from both direct feedback and convenor conversations:\n\n- Future events will benefit from clear descriptions and definitions around ChangeMedium and the purpose of the event.\n- Converging research and development in the medium for change is a unique, engaging, and valuable approach.\n- Research presentations featuring examples involving social impact and underserved communities engage developers to step outside their box.\n- The worldcafe format is very effective in bringing the participants together and should be expanded.\n- During the hack session, conversation can be as valuable as development. Creating an open space format allows for the participants to make the most of the time available.\n- Specifically for hacking, it would be helpful to have an ongoing development track such as contributing to the OpenMicroBlogging infrastructure.\n- Hacking of specific applications could also be aided by pairing participants at the start of the session with the specific objective of creating an application by the end of the day. \u00a0These pairings could be done between researchers and developers and could be focused on a specific topic or left to each pair to decide.\n- There is an unmet opportunity to help researchers engage directly with developers. This engagement is conventionally limited by the research incentive structure pointing to the need to offer new incentives to researchers for engaging earlier and iteratively in their research processes\n\nIn summary, cmToronto demonstrated the unique value of convening researchers and developers in the medium of change to achieve practical outcomes. Despite the initial ambiguity and Saturday timing, we had 40 registrants with 26 participants coming from as far as Halifax. Active progress was made on the OpenMicroBlogging infrastructure, an application for local political engagement, and the future direction of ChangeMedium itself. A clear call was heard for a series of local events, an online blog-based community, and an ongoing thread of practical development activity culminating in an annual event for the local communities to convene.\n\nThis recap of course would not be complete without a big thanks to\u00a0[the participants](http:\/\/tr.im\/cmToronto) and those who made it possible. #cmToronto was hosted by [SiG@MaRS](http:\/\/www.marsdd.com\/About-MaRS\/Partners\/sig.html) and convened by [Ryan Coleman](http:\/\/twitter.com\/ryancoleman), [Renjie Butalid](http:\/\/twitter.com\/renjie), [Lisa Torjman](http:\/\/twitter.com\/lisatorjman), and James Walker.

It\u2019s great to see how quickly the kids came together to make this happen. They\u2019re learning that joy of coming together and creating something for a greater purpose.

It was also another [ChangeMedium](http:\/\/ChangeMedium.org) experiment \u2013 bringing the context of the medium of change to the developers building its future.\n\nThe event was an excellent day with over two dozen folks including the [Status.net](http:\/\/status.net\/ \"status.net\") team and [Peter Deitz](http:\/\/twitter.com\/peterdeitz) of [SocialActions](http:\/\/www.socialactions.com\/ \"Social Actions\"). It was an amazing event to learn about where Status.net and the [OpenMicroBlogging](http:\/\/openmicroblogging.org\/ \"OpenMicroBlogging\") initiative (OMB) are going. \u00a0The wiki has [more details on OMB](http:\/\/status.net\/wiki\/OpenMicroblogging_and_Federation) but it is due for a major new release and will be integrating [PubSubHubBub](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/pubsubhubbub\/), [ActivityStrea.ms](http:\/\/activitystrea.ms), [Salmon](http:\/\/www.salmon-protocol.org\/), and [WebFinger](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/webfinger\/ \"WebFinger\"). \u00a0What this means is an integration of emerging protocols to put people at the centre of micro-messaging. Not only is this a positive protocol development, but it signals the collaboration of major participants in this field to create an 0pen, interoperable system \u2013 an essential aspect of the medium of change.\n\nI also presented a new pitch (below) on why all this really matters to all of us. It prompted a good session on [social uses for Status.net](http:\/\/status.net\/wiki\/Social_Use_of_StatusNet) and sparked a number of unexpected side conversations. What I\u2019m learning more and more is that many developers have a social streak \u2013 a bent for making the world better. Many don\u2019t publicize it but it seems that most do. This is encouraging as I look forward to future ChangeMedium events and seems to fit with the notion of bringing research, development, and application together to build this medium better.\n\nFollowing that thread, I received some great suggestions for ways to do just that including compiling social use cases for developers to hack, doing developer challenges \u2013 prizing the best apps\/hacks, and focused dev days to tackle specific problems.

It was also another <a href=\"http:\/\/ChangeMedium.org\">ChangeMedium<\/a> experiment &#8211; bringing the context of the medium of change to the developers building its future.<\/p>\n<p>The event was an excellent day with over two dozen folks including the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"status.net\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/status.net\/\">Status.net<\/a> team and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/peterdeitz\">Peter Deitz<\/a> of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Social Actions\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/www.socialactions.com\/\">SocialActions<\/a>. It was an amazing event to learn about where Status.net and the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"OpenMicroBlogging\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/openmicroblogging.org\/\">OpenMicroBlogging<\/a> initiative (OMB) are going. \u00a0The wiki has <a href=\"http:\/\/status.net\/wiki\/OpenMicroblogging_and_Federation\">more details on OMB<\/a> but it is due for a major new release and will be integrating <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/pubsubhubbub\/\">PubSubHubBub<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/activitystrea.ms\">ActivityStrea.ms<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salmon-protocol.org\/\">Salmon<\/a>, and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"WebFinger\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/webfinger\/\">WebFinger<\/a>. \u00a0What this means is an integration of emerging protocols to put people at the centre of micro-messaging. Not only is this a positive protocol development, but it signals the collaboration of major participants in this field to create an 0pen, interoperable system &#8211; an essential aspect of the medium of change.<\/p>\n<p>I also presented a new pitch (below) on why all this really matters to all of us. It prompted a good session on <a href=\"http:\/\/status.net\/wiki\/Social_Use_of_StatusNet\">social uses for Status.net<\/a> and sparked a number of unexpected side conversations. What I&#8217;m learning more and more is that many developers have a social streak &#8211; a bent for making the world better. Many don&#8217;t publicize it but it seems that most do. This is encouraging as I look forward to future ChangeMedium events and seems to fit with the notion of bringing research, development, and application together to build this medium better.<\/p>\n<p>Following that thread, I received some great suggestions for ways to do just that including compiling social use cases for developers to hack, doing developer challenges &#8211; prizing the best apps\/hacks, and focused dev days to tackle specific problems.

It was full of new adventures and an unexpected closure of [an old one](http:\/\/cleanenergydevelopments.com\/). 2009 started with a bunch of excitement and energy around the [Social Venture Commons](http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/MichaelLewkowitz\/the-social-venture-commons-1130928), [VenTwits](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post371), and [Thread.io](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post406). A group of us had come together and were sweating out an experiment in peer-producing some apps that we thought could help people come together and build a better world by using [public micro-messaging](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post355). We had some encouraging feedback on the concepts but we missed the mark and didn\u2019t get enough traction (users or funding). We had felt we were constantly 2 weeks ahead of \u2018everyone else\u2019 and when we took stock of what we felt we\u2019d need to get to a [viable venture](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Viable_System_Model), we just couldn\u2019t do it with what we had. I had failed at guiding us through to a [viable product](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minimum_viable_product) and estimating what it would take to get us there.\n\nAt the same time, my [past life](http:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/in\/michaellewkowitz) in energy and finance rose up and I became engaged in designing a financing framework around what the [Green Energy Act Alliance](http:\/\/greenenergyact.ca\/) hoped would make Ontario North America\u2019s leading jurisdiction for renewable energy ([it did](http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/367010034\/al-gore-has-called-the-green-energy-act-the)) and particularly [community power](http:\/\/www.ontario-sea.org\/Page.asp?PageID=751&SiteNodeID=202). [The Act](http:\/\/www.greenenergyact.ca\/Page.asp?PageID=1224&SiteNodeID=202&BL_ExpandID=44) was tabled in May which then prompted another engagement to help the [CPFund](http:\/\/www.cpfund.ca\/) plan for a transition to the new reality. That plan, if successful, stands to be a great example of [social finance](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_finance) and turn the renewable energy finance sector on it\u2019s head.\n\nClosing out the summer, my social finance sojourn continued with the opportunity to co-lead a [Canadian contingent](http:\/\/www.socialfinance.ca\/blog\/post\/canadians_at_socap09\/) to the [Social Capital Markets](http:\/\/www.socialcapitalmarkets.net\/) conference. Next came the privilege of doing a review of [Vartana](http:\/\/vartana.org) \u2013 an ambitious project that aimed to change the way the charitable sector banked in Canada.\u00a0And then things shifted.\n\nOn my birthday I learned that a company I founded was in discussions on being acquired. Those talks [came to fruition](http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/finance\/stocks\/keyDevelopments?rpc=66&symbol=NRG.TO&timestamp=20091005130000) in early October, and while not a big exit by many standards, for [our](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/michaellewkowitz\/4096824703\/in\/set-72157622662336785) lean life it was\/is a big turning point. It meant taking a breath and taking stock. It meant getting \u2018our house in order\u2019. It meant saying thank-you to those who\u2019ve supported me.\n\nAn adventurous chapter with an unexpected plot twist was over.

So here goes.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 233px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"Into the wild. by Michael Lewkowitz, on Flickr\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/michaellewkowitz\/4096825949\/\"><img src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2561\/4096825949_c625900066.jpg\" alt=\"Into the wild.\" width=\"233\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Into the Wild<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>2009 was a pivotal one for me &#8211; a year of transition. It was full of new adventures and an unexpected closure of <a href=\"http:\/\/cleanenergydevelopments.com\/\">an old one<\/a>. 2009 started with a bunch of excitement and energy around the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/MichaelLewkowitz\/the-social-venture-commons-1130928\">Social Venture Commons<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post371\">VenTwits<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post406\">Thread.io<\/a>. A group of us had come together and were sweating out an experiment in peer-producing some apps that we thought could help people come together and build a better world by using  <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post355\">public micro-messaging<\/a>. We had some encouraging feedback on the concepts but we missed the mark and didn&#8217;t get enough traction (users or funding). We had felt we were constantly 2 weeks ahead of &#8216;everyone else&#8217; and when we took stock of what we felt we&#8217;d need to get to a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Viable_System_Model\">viable venture<\/a>, we just couldn&#8217;t do it with what we had. I had failed at guiding us through to a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minimum_viable_product\">viable product<\/a> and estimating what it would take to get us there.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, my <a href=\"http:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/in\/michaellewkowitz\">past life<\/a> in energy and finance rose up and I became engaged in designing a financing framework around what the <a href=\"http:\/\/greenenergyact.ca\/\">Green Energy Act Alliance<\/a> hoped would make Ontario North America&#8217;s leading jurisdiction for renewable energy (<a href=\"http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/367010034\/al-gore-has-called-the-green-energy-act-the\">it did<\/a>) and particularly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ontario-sea.org\/Page.asp?PageID=751&amp;SiteNodeID=202\">community power<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greenenergyact.ca\/Page.asp?PageID=1224&amp;SiteNodeID=202&amp;BL_ExpandID=44\">The Act<\/a> was tabled in May which then prompted another engagement to help the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpfund.ca\/\">CPFund<\/a> plan for a transition to the new reality. That plan, if successful, stands to be a great example of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_finance\">social finance<\/a> and turn the renewable energy finance sector on it&#8217;s head.<\/p>\n<p>Closing out the summer, my social finance sojourn continued with the opportunity to co-lead a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialfinance.ca\/blog\/post\/canadians_at_socap09\/\">Canadian contingent<\/a> to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialcapitalmarkets.net\/\">Social Capital Markets<\/a> conference. Next came the privilege of doing a review of <a href=\"http:\/\/vartana.org\">Vartana<\/a> &#8211; an ambitious project that aimed to change the way the charitable sector banked in Canada.\u00a0And then things shifted.<\/p>\n<p>On my birthday I learned that a company I founded was in discussions on being acquired. Those talks <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/finance\/stocks\/keyDevelopments?rpc=66&amp;symbol=NRG.TO&amp;timestamp=20091005130000\">came to fruition<\/a> in early October, and while not a big exit by many standards, for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/michaellewkowitz\/4096824703\/in\/set-72157622662336785\">our<\/a> lean life it was\/is a big turning point. It meant taking a breath and taking stock. It meant getting &#8216;our house in order&#8217;. It meant saying thank-you to those who&#8217;ve supported me.<\/p>\n<p>An adventurous chapter with an unexpected plot twist was over.

To give it some flavour I decided to share my experience. But first, fair warning. If you are someone who doesn\u2019t like \u2018fluffy stuff\u2019 you may not want to keep reading\u2026 but then again you may also then miss what I\u2019ve found to be the most purely practical thing possible.\n\nSince my youth I\u2019ve been interested in existential questions like is this world just a dream? And if it\u2019s a dream, is it my dream that everyone is a part of or am I part of someone else\u2019s dream along with everything else? Over the years I had fun conversations with my friends, dipped into things like physics, philosophy, raiki, and buddhism but nothing seemed to stick. Then early in 2007 I was staying with a good friend and we got into this favourite conversation of mine with him and his partner. Over the next two evenings his partner asked me some deeply simple questions and shared some recordings from [Adyashanti](http:\/\/adyashanti.org) and a book by [\u201cJed McKenna\u201d](http:\/\/www.spiritualteachers.org\/jed_mckenna.htm). On my way home that next night I was reading the book when right in between two words something in me awoke.\n\nI felt the answer in those early questions in every part of me. In fact, every question I\u2019d ever had was over. I look around and giggled. It was surreal. Everything I was seeing was a dream, an illusion and at the same time I \u2018knew\u2019 it to be the same thing. It, everything, was complete.\n\nThe next days and weeks were odd. Words seemed somehow foreign and it was impossible to articulate what I was experiencing. I would wake up in the mornings and have no inclination to either get out of bed or to stay in bed. There was no will. I had another chat with my friends, one of whom had had a similar experience, and they warned me that what had awoke would \u2018fall back asleep\u2019 and suggested that at some point it might be good to go see Adyashanti. I had no care or desire for either. Sure enough though, while I never \u2018forgot\u2019 what awoke, sometime shortly after I did snuggle back up into the dream and in October of last year I signed up to see Adyashanti. It took 3 years to play out but at the end of March this year I participated in my first silent retreat.\n\nThe [basic structure](http:\/\/www.adyashanti.org\/index.php?file=daily_schedule) of retreat is about [being silent together](http:\/\/www.adyashanti.org\/index.php?file=silence). It is in silence that what awoke in me exists \u2013 like in the gap between the two words of [the book I was reading](http:\/\/www.wisefoolpress.com\/setdt.htm). The format for the day is a series of five 40 minute silent sitting sessions and two 2 hour long talks by Adyashanti. During the talks people are invited to ask Adya questions but beyond that we are silent \u2013 no talking, no gestures, no reading.\n\nGoing in I thought this would be hard. I like talking and I love ranting. But I was also looking forward to it because I like being alone, not feeling like I have to talk or respond to anyone else. As the retreat set in I found the silence enjoyable, sometimes awkward, but not difficult. I began seeing through some patterns in my life and by the 3rd night what was to come of this was showing up.\n\nMy mind is not quiet. Silent sitting is not a silent experience for me. Not at all. Through it though, I actually began to see how much energy I put into building up beliefs, beliefs of how things are and of who I am. Beliefs that give meaning to my life and what I do. Beliefs that give me things to fight, change, and be. Beliefs that I use to validate and to demean myself \u2013 or rather the identity I\u2019ve built up of myself. And there in lies the joke. None of it is real. I build these beliefs and then I do battle with them or use them as a reason to do battle with what is. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it\u2019s addictive.\n\nIf I\u2019m honest I can easily say that at least half, probably more like 90-99% of my energy, my mind goes into building and battling with beliefs. So what would I be if I let those beliefs go? What would I do? What would I know? Scary questions, because they flirt with idea of being absolutely ordinary, or existentially, nothing at all. Or at least that\u2019s how we understand it with our minds. The answer is more likely however that I would simply do whatever the moment called for, in ways that responded to what\u2019s really real and in ways not limited by my beliefs. Worst case? I stop feeding the insanity of the world we find ourselves in. I stop my own bullshit. In either case, what could be more purely, powerfully practical than that. For the life of me I can\u2019t imagine a thing.\n\nAnd so I find myself building a bonfire of beliefs. Watching life as it moves.

To give it some flavour I decided to share my experience. But first, fair warning. If you are someone who doesn&#8217;t like &#8216;fluffy stuff&#8217; you may not want to keep reading\u2026 but then again you may also then miss what I&#8217;ve found to be the most purely practical thing possible.<\/p>\n<p>Since my youth I&#8217;ve been interested in existential questions like is this world just a dream? And if it&#8217;s a dream, is it my dream that everyone is a part of or am I part of someone else&#8217;s dream along with everything else? Over the years I had fun conversations with my friends, dipped into things like physics, philosophy, raiki, and buddhism but nothing seemed to stick. Then early in 2007 I was staying with a good friend and we got into this favourite conversation of mine with him and his partner. Over the next two evenings his partner asked me some deeply simple questions and shared some recordings from <a href=\"http:\/\/adyashanti.org\">Adyashanti<\/a> and a book by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spiritualteachers.org\/jed_mckenna.htm\">&#8220;Jed McKenna&#8221;<\/a>. On my way home that next night I was reading the book when right in between two words something in me awoke.<\/p>\n<p>I felt the answer in those early questions in every part of me. In fact, every question I&#8217;d ever had was over. I look around and giggled. It was surreal. Everything I was seeing was a dream, an illusion and at the same time I &#8216;knew&#8217; it to be the same thing. It, everything, was complete.<\/p>\n<p>The next days and weeks were odd. Words seemed somehow foreign and it was impossible to articulate what I was experiencing. I would wake up in the mornings and have no inclination to either get out of bed or to stay in bed. There was no will. I had another chat with my friends, one of whom had had a similar experience, and they warned me that what had awoke would &#8216;fall back asleep&#8217; and suggested that at some point it might be good to go see Adyashanti. I had no care or desire for either. Sure enough though, while I never &#8216;forgot&#8217; what awoke, sometime shortly after I did snuggle back up into the dream and in October of last year I signed up to see Adyashanti. It took 3 years to play out but at the end of March this year I participated in my first silent retreat.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adyashanti.org\/index.php?file=daily_schedule\">basic structure<\/a> of retreat is about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adyashanti.org\/index.php?file=silence\">being silent together<\/a>. It is in silence that what awoke in me exists &#8211; like in the gap between the two words of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wisefoolpress.com\/setdt.htm\">the book I was reading<\/a>. The format for the day is a series of five 40 minute silent sitting sessions and two 2 hour long talks by Adyashanti. During the talks people are invited to ask Adya questions but beyond that we are silent &#8211; no talking, no gestures, no reading.<\/p>\n<p>Going in I thought this would be hard. I like talking and I love ranting. But I was also looking forward to it because I like being alone, not feeling like I have to talk or respond to anyone else. As the retreat set in I found the silence enjoyable, sometimes awkward, but not difficult. I began seeing through some patterns in my life and by the 3rd night what was to come of this was showing up.<\/p>\n<p>My mind is not quiet. Silent sitting is not a silent experience for me. Not at all. Through it though, I actually began to see how much energy I put into building up beliefs, beliefs of how things are and of who I am. Beliefs that give meaning to my life and what I do. Beliefs that give me things to fight, change, and be. Beliefs that I use to validate and to demean myself &#8211; or rather the identity I&#8217;ve built up of myself. And there in lies the joke. None of it is real. I build these beliefs and then I do battle with them or use them as a reason to do battle with what is. It&#8217;s ridiculous. And it&#8217;s addictive.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m honest I can easily say that at least half, probably more like 90-99% of my energy, my mind goes into building and battling with beliefs. So what would I be if I let those beliefs go? What would I do? What would I know? Scary questions, because they flirt with idea of being absolutely ordinary, or existentially, nothing at all. Or at least that&#8217;s how we understand it with our minds. The answer is more likely however that I would simply do whatever the moment called for, in ways that responded to what&#8217;s really real and in ways not limited by my beliefs. Worst case? I stop feeding the insanity of the world we find ourselves in. I stop my own bullshit. In either case, what could be more purely, powerfully practical than that. For the life of me I can&#8217;t imagine a thing.<\/p>\n<p>And so I find myself building a bonfire of beliefs. Watching life as it moves. Looking for my beliefs at play and offering them as fuel for the bonfire to burn up the bullshit that consumes my life, asking instead to rest in reality as it unfolds.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s next? Who knows. Probably more of the same of what my life has been, just with less bullshit in the gaps in-between.<\/p>\n<p>Now if you read through to here and have questions feel free to ask away. Don&#8217;t want to identify yourself? No problem, do it anonymously. And if I get around to it, I might also share any questions and responses that come up from in person conversations. Or I may not. We&#8217;ll see. Here&#8217;s to letting reality be what it is.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 05 Apr 2010 11:58:08 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 05 Apr 2010 11:58:08 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 05 Apr 2010 11:58:08 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":613,"title":"Hunches on the evolution of scholarly publishing","slug":"hunches-on-the-evolution-of-scholarly-publishing","markdown":"\nAs part of [ChangeMedium](http:\/\/changemedium.org) I\u2019ve been exploring ways to surface and accelerate research related to this emerging system of social technologies. The idea of creating a journal on [the medium of change](http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/MichaelLewkowitz\/the-medium-of-change-context) came up in our [October event](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post500). What follows are some hunches about the evolution of academic publishing arising from that work. If you are involved or interested in this field, I\u2019d love to get your reactions and perspectives\n\n**Background on research and academic publication.**\n\nResearch is a disciplined process. It is [the search for knowledge or any systematic investigation to establish facts](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Research). In support of that,\u00a0[academic publishing](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Research#Publishing) exists to enable the peer-review (meant to validate and improve the quality of research) and make the findings more broadly available. [It began in earnest in the 17th century](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Academic_publishing#History) and served to help establish priority for researcher\u2019s discoveries. Since then it continues to evolve, albeit slowly. Like many systems it is considered by many to be [facing crisis](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Academic_publishing#Crisis) and [looking for a future](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Academic_publishing#The_future_of_academic_publishing) empowered through the emerging system of social technologies.\n\n**Limitations on research resulting from the academic publication system.**\n\nAcademic publication began in service of researchers and scholarly pursuit and gave birth to today\u2019s scholarly journals. Those journals serve as a primary validation vehicle for research findings and so have come to hold substantial influence in the research community. In spite of original intentions however, that influence now appears to be creating some counterproductive limitations.\n\n* Restricted distribution.  \n*Journals rely primarily on publishing fees and content revenues for their financial viability. This creates incentive to restrict researchers from publishing in other places and to limit availability of published content to those willing to pay. While financial viability is essential to any initiative this revenue model is counterproductive to the original aim of making the findings broadly available. While new revenue models have yet to establish themselves it is a necessity if that aim is to be fulfilled. Examples from other publishing sectors may provide clues as to potential models but will not necessarily meet the particular aims and needs of the research community.\n\n* Retardation of research.  \n*Peer-review, a central aspect of many academic publications, requires the participation of several researchers actively engaged in the field of research. Where research is novel or part of an emergent domain, this may be particularly difficult. As pioneering researcher\u2019s search for alternative pathways\u00a0to establish their priority in the field\u00a0such as personal blog and book publishing place even greater demands on their time making them less available or interested in participating. While it is an important component in the research process it also appears to retard the pursuit of novel research and emergent domains.\n\n* Discouragement of participation.*  \n<span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Because\u00a0the process of scholarly pursuit is well documented, it could arguably be engaged in by any competent person willing to do so. The social and procedural dynamics of publication however appear unwelcoming to all but those dependent on publication for their careers. This would appear to limit the participation in scholarly publication to a small subset of those actually able to contribute.<\/span>\n\n**Opportunities for evolution.**\n\nThe emerging system of social technologies have an inherent capacity to facilitate participation and distribution. Their digital nature also affords extraordinary measurability. These attributes create several opportunities for the evolution of academic publishing in ways that could improve the quality of research, distribution of findings, scope and pace of scholarly pursuit, and breadth and experience of participation.\n\n*Measurement of influence and value.  \n*Central to academic publishing is the validation of the research through peer-review and measures of influence such as citation tracking. Social technologies provide an opportunity to improve and expand on the measurement of both the influence and the value of published research to different communities. For example\u00a0an article might be validated according to a scholarly grade generated by an editorial board, number of scholarly references, number of comments and average rating received on the publication site, and number of article references made across the whole of the web.\u00a0These measurements could be further segmented according to specific categories such as peers and public providing additional relevance. Through these techniques researchers, publishers, and the public would gain a more robust and accurate reflection of a published work\u2019s influence and value in the context that matters to them.\n\n* Peer-participation.  \n*The capacity of social technologies to facilitate peer-participation could be leveraged throughout different phases and forms of research in many ways. For example, a system such as [Uservoice](http:\/\/uservoice.com) could be used to identify potential research problems with the greatest interest. Multiple people could be engaged in fleshing out the most popular research problems, creating a resource of relevant existing research and information in wiki format. While experiments with peer-participation are already underway in the research, editing, and [even peer-review](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peer_review#Dynamic_and_open_peer_review) phases these are but early experiments. As evidenced through the unpredictable rise of [Wikipedia](http:\/\/wikipedia.org) there is undoubtedly opportunity to go much further particularly in exploring individual phases and tasks of the research and publication process.\n\n* Parallel pursuit.  \n*The digital publishing infrastructure coupled with the social and collaborative dynamics of the web could further encourage parallel private and public pursuit of specific research problems or topics. While researchers may choose to maintain a private and closed research approach their research problem could be made publicly available for parallel pursuit. Public findings and contributions could provide valuable material for the primary researcher\u2019s activity. Enabling researcher\u2019s to self-select their mode of research alongside parallel public participation could break the tension between approaches and accelerate innovation in the research publication process.\n\n**Invitation to experiment.**\n\nWhile the above are merely a set of hunches, from an entrepreneurial perspective they point to some interesting opportunities to experiment. While I welcome any interest in experiment regards to the journal on the medium of change, I would also love to hear of any other experiments planned or underway. Some particular areas of interest to me are:\n\n* Research influence and valuation tracking system.*  \n<span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Starting points for this investigation could include exploring opportunities to extend current peer-evaluation methods, identifying opportunities to expand and improve upon citation tracking, and finally opening a new category of public influence and valuation metrics.<\/span>\n\n* Peer-participation opportunity map.  \n*Starting points for this investigation could include exploring opportunities to employ existing tools and techniques in each of the primary tasks and phases of research and publication.\n\n* Publishing system specification.*  \n Starting points for this investigation could include scoping a minimum viable system to support this evolution, followed by assessing applicability of existing tools such as\u00a0[Open Journal Systems](http:\/\/pkp.sfu.ca\/?q=ojs) from the [Public Knowledge Project](http:\/\/pkp.sfu.ca\/), and then proceding with [agile development](Agile_software_development) of the necessary features.\n\nAs our society quickens its pace of evolution, we would only benefit from a corresponding quickening in the evolution of research and its publication. While research isn\u2019t my bag in life, I have come to recognize the powerful role it can play in society.\n\n***Other references:***\n\n- [Academic journal \u2013 Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scholarly_journal)\n- [Open access journal \u2013 Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Open_access_journal)\n- [Peer review \u2013 Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peer_review)\n- [Scholarly method \u2013 Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scholarly_method)\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As part of <a href=\"http:\/\/changemedium.org\">ChangeMedium<\/a> I&#8217;ve been exploring ways to surface and accelerate research related to this emerging system of social technologies.

I\u2019ve jotted them down here as hunches to look back on rather than a epiphany of understanding.\n\n**Failure**  \n Systemic failures can and will happen. They will happen often and their occurrence is an excellent opportunity to better understand your systems and the things that system is interacting with. Elimination of failure is impossible and probably unhealthy. Not learning from it is irresponsible and undoubtedly inefficient. Also, failure is subjective. What might look like massive failure to one participant in the system maybe be inconsequential to the rest of the system and vice versa.\n\n**Design**  \n Systems design should never have compliance as an objective. Compliance is a condition. Designing for base targets turns a system inwards as opposed to inspiring it to grow and contribute. Designing for purpose and even tangential goals might produce unexpected gains, quite possibly from the failures it produces. The design should go further to anticipate those failures, make them small and handle escalation of failure iteratively to do everything possible, not just the minimum required to avoid massive failure from the perspective of **any** participant in the system. And finally, people are a valuable part of any system. Our capacity to process patterns and complexity is unparalleled. Designing them out of the system can actually decrease efficiency and efficacy.\n\n**Purpose**  \n Like any system, it\u2019s purpose and patterns permeate it\u2019s entirety. Purpose should be productive and pull the system forward. It is its reason for being. When system designers lose their sense of purpose and instead boil, or allow a system to be boiled down to a spec list it will all but guarantee a lifeless system. The system may well meet the criteria of the project, but it will have lost the greater purpose it is there to fulfill.\n\nIn my recent experience, a system failure on my end collided with a system failure in a regulated utility. On my part I relied on more signal than I was getting from the utility. On the utilities part, they relied entirely one communication channel (on-bill messaging), the minimum required by law. They failed to use multiple failure signals (un-paid bills), or changes in patterns corresponding to changes in systems, or their in the street people with a relationship to the customer, to stop the repeating failure. Instead they allowed the system to escalate to a costly and inconvenient option of physical gas disconnect, something that could have been avoided with an email, mailer, phone call, or on door notice\u2026 all which would have cost the company far less and allowed a customer relationship to be fulfilled.\n\nWhy it happened I suspect has to do with an image of a customer as a switch as opposed to a human. As a regulated utility with monopolistic privilege it is understandable to see how this might develop, and it is likely an expression of the nature of the current purpose of the organization. From my perspective, it sure seems to make sense and whether it is indeed true or not, it is how I will perceive and express those perceptions of that utility. And that\u2019s my final lesson\u2026 if the purpose of the system is subjective, and if purpose permeates systems, the failures of a system could have disproportionately large influence on the ultimate purpose of the system\u2026 so design with purpose, design for failure, and design with care.\n\n\n","html":"<p>My <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post4060\">recent adventures<\/a> with my local utility offered up some great lessons on system failure, design, and purpose.

It\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re in a period of intense change, where the many systems of our society have reached their limits, where our civilization is set to pivot.\n\nBack in 2001, [Ervin Laszlo](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ervin_L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3 \"Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3\") wrote about this in [Macroshift](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Macroshift-Navigating-Transformation-Sustainable-World\/dp\/1576751635). He found a common pattern in civilizations over the course of our history. They set out on a trajectory based on certain combination of technology and mindset. At some point, that trajectory becomes unsustainable and the civilizations reach, like any system, a [bifurcation point](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bifurcation_theory \"Bifurcation theory\"). Either they breakthrough based on a new combo of technology and mindset or they breakdown. While breakdown is alarming, it\u2019s been pretty common in the history of civilization. The only problem is, this is the first time our civilization has been global. Breakdown would really, really suck.\n\nToday, I believe that the emerging system of social technologies and the corresponding mindset founded in connectedness and purpose are the combination that offer a new, more sustainable trajectory. By social technologies I mean both the tangible ones enabling the mobile, [social web](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_web \"Social web\"), and the intangible ones like facilitation, inquiry, [design](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Design \"Design\"), engagement and organization.\n\nPerhaps the most simple and compelling reason is that where we find our selves is a product of what we\u2019ve created in the past. Similarly the only way we can fix it is by creating new things that put us on that new trajectory. For that to happen, we need to move fast and from a different place than we did when we created this mess. And that\u2019s where the social technologies and mindset come in. Social technologies give us unprecendented capacity to create effectively and efficiently.

It&#8217;s pretty clear we&#8217;re in a period of intense change, where the many systems of our society have reached their limits, where our civilization is set to pivot.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2001, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ervin_L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3\">Ervin Laszlo<\/a> wrote about this in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Macroshift-Navigating-Transformation-Sustainable-World\/dp\/1576751635\">Macroshift<\/a>. He found a common pattern in civilizations over the course of our history. They set out on a trajectory based on certain combination of technology and mindset. At some point, that trajectory becomes unsustainable and the civilizations reach, like any system, a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Bifurcation theory\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bifurcation_theory\">bifurcation point<\/a>. Either they breakthrough based on a new combo of technology and mindset or they breakdown. While breakdown is alarming, it&#8217;s been pretty common in the history of civilization. The only problem is, this is the first time our civilization has been global. Breakdown would really, really suck.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I believe that the emerging system of social technologies and the corresponding mindset founded in connectedness and purpose are the combination that offer a new, more sustainable trajectory. By social technologies I mean both the tangible ones enabling the mobile, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Social web\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_web\">social web<\/a>, and the intangible ones like facilitation, inquiry, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Design\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Design\">design<\/a>, engagement and organization.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most simple and compelling reason is that where we find our selves is a product of what we&#8217;ve created in the past. Similarly the only way we can fix it is by creating new things that put us on that new trajectory. For that to happen, we need to move fast and from a different place than we did when we created this mess. And that&#8217;s where the social technologies and mindset come in. Social technologies give us unprecendented capacity to create effectively and efficiently. The mindset, on the other hand, gives us the presence and perspective to do it more constructively.<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s how I think we&#8217;ll make our pivot. Ventures do it all the time on their path to success. Civilizations have proven they can do it to. Now it&#8217;s our turn to do it together.<\/p>\n<p>From where I sit, I know we need to, I think we can, I believe we will.<\/p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles by Zemanta<\/h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/ervin-laszlo\/the-g-20-vision-is-obsole_b_658297.html\">Ervin Laszlo: The G-20 Vision Is Obsolete<\/a> (huffingtonpost.com)<\/li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.startuplessonslearned.com\/2009\/06\/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html\">Pivot, don&#8217;t jump to a new vision<\/a> (startuplessonslearned.com)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http:\/\/www.zemanta.com\/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.zemanta.com\/zemified_a.png?x-id=ca5fe3d5-a3d2-4eac-a9bd-52077eee2633\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" \/><\/a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http:\/\/static.zemanta.com\/readside\/loader.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"><\/script><\/span><\/div>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 14:51:06 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 14:51:06 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 14:51:06 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":6908,"title":"The new 'Organization'.

In both Future and Pull the authors are more critical of the dehumanizing effect of command and control driven organizations and zero-sum management practices. They all argue that control restrains the creativity, humanity and innovation needed for any organization to thrive and adapt in complex and dynamic environments. Designing and managing organizations is increasingly about creating and conditioning spaces for passionate people to pursue a common purpose.\n\n**Organizations are human first**\n\nIn Heart, Beer talked about the ultimate manager being someone who achieved enlightenment \u2013 someone who was fully alive and aware of who they were. Similarly he saw the optimal organization as one \u2018exploding into self-consciousness\u2019. Future and Pull more simply recognize that people are at their best when they are free to pursue what matters to them, in short, when they are treated as human beings, not production resources.

Its purpose is primarily for being able to sense for incipient instabilities and opportunities within and around the system in focus. This networked perspective is more fully fleshed out in Future through a case illustrating the power of prediction markets in achieving more accurate forecasts than the best analysts. Pull goes further drawing from examples of how sharing, production and collaboration through social media foster natural innovation and illustrate how these dynamics lead to increasing returns. In fact, they argue, that the real value of an organization lies in its networks of long-term relationships.\n\n**Social technology playing a pivotal role**\n\nBefore Beer wrote Heart, he led [a Star Trek-esque roject](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cybersyn) using telex machines in Chile to manage a centrally planned economy. It\u2019s hard not to have a chuckle at first glance, but the core principles of the design are at the core of the opportunity in the emerging ecosystem of social technologies we have at our disposal today. In Future, written at the start of Web 2.0, Hamel boldly declares \u201cArgue with me if you like, but I\u2019m willing to bet that Management 2.0 is going to look a lot more like Web 2.0\u2033. While the novelty of Web 2.0 had worn off a bit by the time Pull came out, the examples of how social technology is enabling people to pursue their passion, connect, and create value are foundational to how organization actually happens today. It is of course about more than the technology, it is about the technology having reached a point where it nurtures, enables and is compatible with the other three themes above. It seems, these technologies are instrumental in allowing organization to happen more naturally, and of course with over 4 billion people connected, at a scale never before imaginable.\n\n**In summary, **it seems that the technology of organization is undergoing a transformation, enabled by our social technologies, and powered by passionate people.

In a world where chaos, connectivity, and creativity have risen to new heights, increased attention on the topic is both natural and welcomed. Quite simply, if <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post6800\">our civilization is set to pivot<\/a>, getting better at it will help us realize a better future, sooner.<\/p>\n<p>My three favourite books on the topic are (reading recommendations at the bottom of this post):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1979, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Heart-Enterprise-Classic-Beer\/dp\/0471948373\/\">The Heart of Enterprise<\/a> (&#8220;Heart&#8221;), <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthony_Stafford_Beer\">Stafford Beer<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post40\">selected quotes<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>2007, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Future-Management-Gary-Hamel\/dp\/1422102505\/\">The Future of Management<\/a> (&#8220;Future&#8221;), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.garyhamel.com\/\">Gary Hamel<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/1210927483\/selected-quotes-from-prof-hamels-the-future-of\">selected quotes<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>2010, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Power-Pull-Smartly-Things-Motion\/dp\/0465019358\/\">The Power of Pull<\/a> (&#8220;Pull&#8221;), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnhagel.com\/index.shtml\">John Hagel III<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnseelybrown.com\/\">John Seely Brown<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.suncirclehealing.com\/home\/who-will-benefit-from-energy-healing\/about-lang-davison\">Lang Davison<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/1211892939\/select-quotes-from-jhagel-jseelybrown-and\">selected quotes<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I recently revisited them <a href=\"http:\/\/tumblog.igniter.com\/post\/1215898048\/doing-a-side-by-side-comparison-of-power-of\">side-by-side<\/a> to see what they had in common. What stood out for me were the themes conditioning, humanity, networks, and social technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conditioning trumps control<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Already back in Heart, Beer recognized the role of management as attending to cohesion, sensing for incipient instability and making the minimum of intervention. In both Future and Pull the authors are more critical of the dehumanizing effect of command and control driven organizations and zero-sum management practices. They all argue that control restrains the creativity, humanity and innovation needed for any organization to thrive and adapt in complex and dynamic environments. Designing and managing organizations is increasingly about creating and conditioning spaces for passionate people to pursue a common purpose.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Organizations are human first<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Heart, Beer talked about the ultimate manager being someone who achieved enlightenment &#8211; someone who was fully alive and aware of who they were. Similarly he saw the optimal organization as one &#8216;exploding into self-consciousness&#8217;. Future and Pull more simply recognize that people are at their best when they are free to pursue what matters to them, in short, when they are treated as human beings, not production resources. Where Pull dives into the shift from transactions to relationships and the role of trust, Future summons the moral imperatives of beauty, truth, love, service, wisdom, justice, freedom, and compassion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>System dynamics dominate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Information flow is at the heart of Beer&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Viable_System_Model\">Viable System Model<\/a> and Heart excels at driving the rigor of design around information sensing, amplification and attenuation. Its purpose is primarily for being able to sense for incipient instabilities and opportunities within and around the system in focus. This\u00a0systems perspective is more fully fleshed out in Future through a case illustrating the power of prediction markets in achieving more accurate forecasts than the best analysts. Pull goes further drawing from examples of how sharing, production and collaboration through social media foster natural innovation and illustrate how these dynamics lead to increasing returns. In fact, they argue, that the real value of an organization lies in its networks of long-term relationships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social technology playing a pivotal role<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before Beer wrote Heart, he led <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cybersyn\">a Star Trek-esque roject<\/a> using telex machines in Chile to manage a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Planned economy\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Planned_economy\">centrally planned economy<\/a>. It&#8217;s hard not to have a chuckle at first glance, but the core principles of the design are at the core of the opportunity in the emerging ecosystem of social technologies we have at our disposal today. In Future, written at the start of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Web 2.0\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_2.0\">Web 2.0<\/a>, Hamel boldly declares &#8220;Argue with me if you like, but I&#8217;m willing to bet that Management 2.0 is going to look a lot more like Web 2.0&#8243;. While the novelty of Web 2.0 had worn off a bit by the time Pull came out, the examples of how social technology is enabling people to pursue their passion, connect, and create value are foundational to how organization actually happens today. It is of course about more than the technology, it is about the technology having reached a point where it nurtures, enables and is compatible with the other three themes above. It seems, these technologies are instrumental in allowing organization to happen more naturally, and of course with over 4 billion people connected, at a scale never before imaginable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In summary, <\/strong>it seems that the technology of organization is undergoing a transformation, enabled by our social technologies, and powered by passionate people. It seems that we naturally are drawn to collaborate around purpose to create a better future, sooner, however that looks to us individually. It seems, even, like a rennaissance of humanity. \u00a0Whatever it is though, it is on the upswing.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what the great thinkers and writers discover next. I&#8217;m also, of course, looking forward to seeing what I can contribute to the game with things like <a href=\"http:\/\/epic.io\">Epic.io<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These are fun times to be alive and engaged.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; for those who haven&#8217;t yet read the above books&#8230; here&#8217;s my quick take on which is best for whom<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heart of Enterprise:<\/strong> A beast of a read but the most accruate understanding of what an organization actually is.

It is the evolution of our civilization.\n\nSocial innovation describes what is happening in more detail. \u00a0[According to Social Innovation Generation](http:\/\/sigeneration.ca\/primer.html):\n\n> \u201cSocial innovation is an initiative, product or process or program that **profoundly changes the basic routines, resource and authority flows or beliefs of any social system** (e.g. individuals, organizations, neighbourhoods, communities, whole societies).\u201d\n\nGoing a bit further, the [Social Innovation Exchange](http:\/\/www.socialinnovationexchange.org\/) and [Young Foundation](http:\/\/www.youngfoundation.org\/ \"Young Foundation\") describe:\n\n> \u201cSocial innovations are innovations that are both social in their ends and in their means. Specifically, we define social innovations as new ideas (products, services and models) that simultaneously meet social needs (more effectively than alternatives) and **create new social relationships or collaborations**. In other words they are innovations that are **both good for society and enhance society\u2019s capacity to act.**\u201c\n\nKeying in on the challenges of dealing with complex systems [Tim Draimin](http:\/\/sigeneration.ca\/people-tim-draimin.html) [observes](http:\/\/sigeneration.ca\/blog\/?p=169) that \u201cAs today\u2019s problems evolve from \u2018complicated\u2019 to \u2018complex\u2019, the expert-led approach falls short.\u201d. In response to this challenge, leaders in social innovation are turning to Innovation Labs for their core capacity to: \u201cPerceive and articulate a common understanding of a challenge; Creatively identify possible solutions; Experiment, prototype, test, outreach; and Implement\u201d. While the concept of these labs borrows loosely from the scientific version of laboratory, it firmly recognizes the increasing importance of\u00a0[social technology](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_technology) in innovation.\n\nThe design of these labs are also being influenced by the iterative, human and user-centred design practices gaining prominence in the digital revolution. A definite response to the increasing personalization of digital technology and the accelerating pace of development, these practices fit particularly well with social innovation and its focus on the needs of people in general and vulnerable populations in particular.\n\nTake [Tyze](http:\/\/www.tyze.com\/) for example. From years of experience, [PLAN](http:\/\/plan.ca\/) knew that the \u00a0key to quality of life for people with disabilities was the quality of their personal network. Combining that insight with the concept of social networks, PLAN created Tyze to help strengthen the networks around its individual members. \u00a0Centred around people with disabilities the site grew rapidly and is now starting to influence\u00a0the way health-care services are provided to its members. While Tyze was an early pioneer in employing digital technology for social innovation in this way, the understanding of its role is becoming more widespread. As [Annika Small](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Annika_Small \"Annika Small\"), director of the [Nominet Trust](http:\/\/www.nominettrust.org.uk\/) describes, \u201cTechnology gives us the opportunity to think differently, develop new social connections and reorganize resources across communities.\u201d\n\nBeyond these types of direct applications, digital technology also has a deeper connection. Like social innovation, digital technology is about connections. The web, or as [Tim-Berners-Lee](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tim_Berners-Lee \"Tim Berners-Lee\") recently described,\u00a0\u201cHumanity linked by tech\u201d, is a rapidly expanding, interconnected\u00a0network of people, places, things and data that\u00a0effectively contains an actionable model of every social system one could aim to affect or create. It is the ultimate social innovation lab and carries unprecedented potential to observe, experiment, develop, and diffuse social innovation. Indeed, as the digital revolution unfolds it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine any social innovation independent of the context and application of digital technology.\n\nAs we navigate this transition, social innovation is emerging as a key enabler of our resilience and our future. At the same time, social and digital technology are emerging as a core foundation for social innovation. And while innovation labs appear to be a cornerstone of that foundation, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve only just begun building. As our civilization transitions we can expect our challenges to deepen and the pace of change to accelerate. As daunting as it can seem, this emerging model of social innovation offers hope for what\u2019s possible and reminds us that now, more than ever, we are building it together.\n\n**Related posts:**\n\n- On the impact of digital technology on our civilization: [The revolution is digital.](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/thoughts\/the-revolution-is-digital\/ \"The revolution is digital\")\n- On the nature and reach of digital technology: [The nature of digital technology.](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/thoughts\/the-nature-of-digital-technology\/ \"The nature of digital technology\")\n- On the situation this civilization finds itself: [Sorry about the hangover.](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/thoughts\/sorry-about-the-hangover\/ \"Sorry about the hangover\")\n\n\n","html":"<p>Humanity is in a chaotic phase, evolving from a civilization born of the industrial revolution to a civilization emerging from the <a title=\"The revolution is digital\" href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/thoughts\/the-revolution-is-digital\/\">digital revolution<\/a>.

Their vision is ambitious and important, and with the right approach it could transform how change happens. \u00a0Here are my hunches about what\u2019s required, and what we\u2019re already doing to make it happen.\n\n**1. Focus on impact**\n\n****It\u2019s easy to get excited about data and information. They\u2019re hot topics, and rightly so. As we wade into the [digital revolution](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post7513), we\u2019re flooded with things demanding our attention. And the things we want others to see keep getting lost in the tsunami of everything else. But let\u2019s step back for a second. \u00a0Think of this like swimming across a river. The goal is to get across the river, not to go for a swim. What I need is a way to get across. And in the case of this infrastructure, what we need goes beyond data standards, quality, and accessibility to include supports that help us achieve impact more efficiently, and with greater efficacy.\n\n**2. Harness networks and relationships**\n\nIf the purpose is to help impact happen, then the infrastructure must also include the people, relationships, and networks involved. Whether it is the person leading change, the team working with them, the ecosystem supporting their effort, our ability to achieve impact is very much [dependent on the networks and relationships](http:\/\/www.nesta.org.uk\/publications\/guest_articles\/assets\/features\/how_social_networks_lead_to_innovation) we bring to bear. Indeed, [understanding networks and relationships](http:\/\/www.ippr.org\/publication\/55\/9888\/the-relational-state-how-recognising-the-importance-of-human-relationships-could-revolutionise-the-role-of-the-state) is coming to be a central challenge in achieving meaningful change. When it comes to information, the same relationships and [informal networks](http:\/\/www.nesta.org.uk\/publications\/guest_articles\/assets\/features\/how_networks_of_trust_can_unlock_innovation) play an increasing role in [how we share and what we discover](http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2187907). This infrastructure needs to tap into our relationships and networks, wherever they are.\n\n**3. Find signal in the noise**\n\n****Despite our best efforts to standardize and improve the quality of data, the vast majority will always be unstructured, inaccurate, and mostly irrelevant *until* we find ways to use it. Who would have thought Twitter would become useful in [earthquake detection](http:\/\/recovery.doi.gov\/press\/us-geological-survey-twitter-earthquake-detector-ted\/) or Google (maybe) in [monitoring flu trends](http:\/\/commonhealth.wbur.org\/2013\/01\/google-flu-trends-cdc). Tapping into this sea of noise could be a core feature of what this infrastructure provides, enabling new, creative approaches to understand how impact happens. With [the majority of humanity](http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-19925506) already able to send messages about the things that are impacting them, even [old ideas](http:\/\/sf.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/44\/3\/327.short) like using [sentiment analysis](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sentiment_analysis) to understand change could bring entirely new insights. This infrastructure needs to rewire the web for impact.\n\n**4. A platform for a new generation of impact enabling tools**\n\n****Of course, as we discover more of what we truly need from this infrastructure, we will find opportunities to build new tools. And no, this does not mean a shiny new place for groups to have conversations that they are already having on Facebook and LinkedIn. And it certainly doesn\u2019t mean [a fridge with a screen, baby monitor, and evernote](http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/5973957\/no-samsung-we-dont-need-a-goddamn-fridge-with-a-screen-baby-monitor-and-evernote). What it does mean are specific impact related tools, resources, and supports like [Fix My Street](http:\/\/www.fixmystreet.com) and [CrowdMap](https:\/\/crowdmap.com); [Innoweave](http:\/\/www.innoweave.ca) and [Open Workshop](https:\/\/openworkshop.nesta.org.uk); and [NationBuilder](http:\/\/nationbuilder.com) and [OpenIDEO](http:\/\/www.openideo.com). For this \u00a0infrastructure to thrive, it needs to support a creative explosion of tools like this.\n\n**The digital infrastructure for the impact ecosystem.**\n\nUltimately, what we are talking about here is more than an information infrastructure. It is a digital infrastructure for the impact ecosystem. If we find our way to making it happen, it would mean the web could work with impact like it can work with location. Just like I can now expect my smartphone to help me find the best route through the most congested traffic: the web could show me search results based on what I\u2019m working on; my social networks could connect with me with the people who could help me have the most impact; and the impact of my actions could be automagically tracked and available to whoever I choose to share it with. Imagine even, not having to respond to yet another sector survey, census, or mapping initiative with the same information you have already provided a dozen times before.\n\nOf course, this may take a decade or more to become reality. It is itself a deeply [systemic innovation](http:\/\/www.nesta.org.uk\/publications\/assets\/features\/systems_innovation_discussion_paper) and requires more than a handful of initiatives. It needs to follow the best practices emerging around [collective impact](http:\/\/www.ssireview.org\/blog\/entry\/channeling_change_making_collective_impact_work) and could do well to harness [new methods for catalyzing social innovation](http:\/\/www.marsdd.com\/2013\/02\/27\/social-innovation-labs-designing-whole-system-change\/). Markets for Good is a great start. It needs to be well supported and to either rise to the level of the impact infrastructure or join with others\u00a0in making it happen.\n\n**Our contributions of interface, infrastructure, and collaboration**\n\nIn our own pocket of the world at [Igniter](http:\/\/igniter.com), we are working towards this in partnership with [Ashoka](http:\/\/ashoka.org), [MaRS](http:\/\/marsdd.com), and the [J.W. McConnell Family Foundation](http:\/\/mcconnellfoundation.ca). What began as a simple experiment has evolved into set of interface, infrastructure and conversations we are calling [socialsca.pe](http:\/\/socialsca.pe).\n\nResponding to ongoing need of mapping who\u2019s doing what in communities all over the world, we began by prototyping the socialsca.pe interface. It is a simple tool for individuals, researchers, and network managers to map, discover, and connect participants in the system. Launching in April with the world\u2019s largest map of social entrepreneurs, it will also be a simple utility for communities to gain insight into their membership and collective networks. And for individuals we aim to create the best weekly email of recommended activity and connections based on their unique relationship to the ecosystem.\n\nAs part of that process we uncovered the need for two new technologies that are central to enabling this digital infrastructure. The first, called the Impact Graph, integrates formal and informal relationship networks with impact data to provide new methods of discovery, analysis, and exploration of the impact ecosystem. The second, scheduled for development this summer, is a Behaviour Engine designed to broadly encourage the behaviours of data gathering and [network weaving](http:\/\/www.networkweaving.com\/blog\/2006\/06\/network-weaving-101.html) across the entire ecosystem. Together, these technologies form the core socialsca.pe infrastructure that we aim to make available for broader use later this year.\n\nWhile we are still prototyping, we have already received requests to develop custom interfaces and applications to support networks of entrepreneurs, link relationship graphs to existing stores of impact data, and generally harness the collective social networks of existing formal communities. \u00a0We are also encountering requests to use our underlying infrastructure to power new and existing applications, saving developers from having to create their own user profile systems and simultaneously leveraging the network awareness that this infrastructure brings.\n\nFinally, in order to help keep our activities aligned with the emerging ecosystem, we have convened a small working group. Members of this group already span 4 countries and will hopefully grow to include representation from the main stakeholder groups in the ecosystem. Alongside this, we are hosting a series of \u2018mini-labs\u2019 to help improve our collective understanding and uncover actionable needs and high-potential interventions. The first of those will happen April 9th in London, UK with the second scheduled for October 1st in Calgary, Canada.\n\n**A better future, sooner.**\n\nWhat has been sparked by Markets for Good is an incredible opportunity, and while building an infrastructure on this scale is ambitious, it\u2019s not any more ambitious than other major infrastructure projects we\u2019ve taken on over history. At the same time, if we consider the challenges we are facing as a civilization, we could find reason to be more motivated than ever before. If we choose to make this happen, the results could go down as the greatest collective effort at increasing our capacity to create a better future, sooner. And to me, that\u2019s worth diving in.\n\n***\n\n*Special thanks to [Tim Draimin](https:\/\/twitter.com\/timdraimin), [Michael Soto](https:\/\/twitter.com\/misoca), and [Scott Wofford](https:\/\/twitter.com\/scottwofford) for their feedback on earlier drafts of this post.*\n\n\n","html":"<p>Eric Henderson of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketsforgood.org\">Markets for Good<\/a> recently asked me what was needed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketsforgood.org\/markets-for-good-upgrading-the-infrastructure-for-social-change\/\">build an information infrastructure for the social sector<\/a>. Their vision is ambitious and important, and with the right approach it could transform how change happens. \u00a0Here are my hunches about what\u2019s required, and what we\u2019re already doing to make it happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Focus on impact<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong>It\u2019s easy to get excited about data and information. They\u2019re hot topics, and rightly so. As we wade into the <a href=\"http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post7513\">digital revolution<\/a>, we\u2019re flooded with things demanding our attention. And the things we want others to see keep getting lost in the tsunami of everything else. But let\u2019s step back for a second. \u00a0Think of this like swimming across a river. The goal is to get across the river, not to go for a swim. What I need is a way to get across. And in the case of this infrastructure, what we need goes beyond data standards, quality, and accessibility to include supports that help us achieve impact more efficiently, and with greater efficacy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Harness networks and relationships<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the purpose is to help impact happen, then the infrastructure must also include the people, relationships, and networks involved. Whether it is the person leading change, the team working with them, the ecosystem supporting their effort, our ability to achieve impact is very much <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nesta.org.uk\/publications\/guest_articles\/assets\/features\/how_social_networks_lead_to_innovation\">dependent on the networks and relationships<\/a> we bring to bear. Indeed, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ippr.org\/publication\/55\/9888\/the-relational-state-how-recognising-the-importance-of-human-relationships-could-revolutionise-the-role-of-the-state\">understanding networks and relationships<\/a> is coming to be a central challenge in achieving meaningful change. When it comes to information, the same relationships and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nesta.org.uk\/publications\/guest_articles\/assets\/features\/how_networks_of_trust_can_unlock_innovation\">informal networks<\/a> play an increasing role in <a href=\"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2187907\">how we share and what we discover<\/a>. This infrastructure needs to tap into our relationships and networks, wherever they are.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Find signal in the noise<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong>Despite our best efforts to standardize and improve the quality of data, the vast majority will always be unstructured, inaccurate, and mostly irrelevant <em>until<\/em> we find ways to use it. Who would have thought Twitter would become useful in <a href=\"http:\/\/recovery.doi.gov\/press\/us-geological-survey-twitter-earthquake-detector-ted\/\">earthquake detection<\/a> or Google (maybe) in <a href=\"http:\/\/commonhealth.wbur.org\/2013\/01\/google-flu-trends-cdc\">monitoring flu trends<\/a>. Tapping into this sea of noise could be a core feature of what this infrastructure provides, enabling new, creative approaches to understand how impact happens. With <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-19925506\">the majority of humanity<\/a> already able to send messages about the things that are impacting them, even <a href=\"http:\/\/sf.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/44\/3\/327.short\">old ideas<\/a> like using <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sentiment_analysis\">sentiment analysis<\/a> to understand change could bring entirely new insights. This infrastructure needs to rewire the web for impact.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. A platform for a new generation of impact enabling tools<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong>Of course, as we discover more of what we truly need from this infrastructure, we will find opportunities to build new tools. And no, this does not mean a shiny new place for groups to have conversations that they are already having on Facebook and LinkedIn. And it certainly doesn\u2019t mean <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/5973957\/no-samsung-we-dont-need-a-goddamn-fridge-with-a-screen-baby-monitor-and-evernote\">a fridge with a screen, baby monitor, and evernote<\/a>.

As these digital technologies spread to [link every person and every thing](http:\/\/lewwwk.com\/post7517), we are beginning to see how digital technology is central to our ability to gather data, engage others, and ultimately create the systems of our future. Indeed, it is impossible to think doing so without it.\n\nExploring this emerging reality, on Tuesday, April 9th, I hosted a mini-lab with [the Nominet Trust](http:\/\/nominettrust.org.uk) in Oxford, UK. With participants from [MaRS](http:\/\/marsdd.com), [Nesta](http:\/\/nesta.org.uk), [Big Lottery Fund](http:\/\/www.biglotteryfund.org.uk), [UNLTD](http:\/\/unltd.org.uk), [the Point People](http:\/\/thepointpeople.com), [SIX](http:\/\/www.socialinnovationexchange.org), and [the Web Science Trust](http:\/\/webscience.org) we explored the landscape, barriers and strategies for realizing the potential of digital for impact. Following is a high level overview of what we discovered, some post-lab reflections, and how we\u2019ll be following-up.\n\n**Discoveries on realizing the full potential of digital for impact.**\n\nDrawing on past experiences, we explored the barriers we each encountered in realizing the full potential of what digital technology has to offer. Across those experiences we uncovered the following set of barriers:\n\n- Lack of enabling infrastructure\n- Lack of coordination\n- Friction between cultures\n- Dysfunctional interactions\n- Bridging how and how-to\n- Sustaining adoption in dynamic change\n- Surviving the data glut\n\nFollowing up on those barriers, we took a look at a host of practical actions that could most help us realize the full potential of digital technology. From those actions emerged the following underlying themes:\n\n- Sharp tools for data discovery and usage\n- F@*k it, ship it, together\n- People powered intelligence\n- Weaving inclusivity\n- Incentivizing systems change\n- Experiential learning and sharing\n\n**Reflections in retrospect**  \n Reflecting back on our conversations throughout the day there are a few additional themes that stood out for me.\n\n*The deep entanglement of digital and social*  \n Originally introduced in 1999 by Tim Berners-Lee, the concept of [social machines](http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/jahendler\/social-machines-oxford-hendler)\u00a0struck an immediate chord in our conversation. Increasingly, our solutions to social challenges draw on tighter and tighter integration humans and digital technology. This linking tends to blur the concepts of consumer and producer, beneficiary and provider, us and them, blending all participants into a \u2018social-machine\u2019 and creating both the tension and the opportunity for entirely new interactions and relationships to emerge.\u00a0In this way, digital technology has become central to designing solutions, understanding systems, and envisioning systemic approaches addressing the needs of society.\n\n*The boundary-busting nature of digital technology*  \n The connective nature of digital technology does not adhere to the sectoral and polititcal boundaries that the impact ecosystem tends to organize around. Data and tools created for use in addressing homelessness in Detroit will likely have utility outside of homelessness and outside of Detroit. And if we think in terms of a digitally connected social machine, every person brings and links to a whole new set of data, people, and systems.\n\nThis boundary-busting nature is in stark contrast to the way the current impact ecosystem flows resources and support. Bound by geo-political and or sectoral boundaries, the sector is not structured to invite, nuture and scale the full potential of digital technology, leading to redundant, under-resourced digital solutions that fail to meet expectations, let alone tap the full potential that participants realize could be possible.\n\n*The systemic opportunity *  \n This deep entanglement of digital and social is an unprecedented opportunity to create entirely new ways of responding to the needs of society. In a handful of years we have created systems like Facebook, Google, and Wikipedia which have unexpectedly transformed how we connect, find, and share information. These are massive social machines that have become underlying infrastructure for how the world works. Our opportunity is to take that approach further, creating infrastructure that creates similarly transformative social machines that serve the basic and underserved needs of humanity.\n\nThe impact ecosystem of course has an important role to play in this. While entrepreneurs will likely contintue to drive new ideas, the ecosystem itself can create new relationships and pathways that enable boundary-busting solutions to emerge and take hold. Indeed, projects like [BRIDGE](http:\/\/www.techsoupglobal.org\/blog\/techsoup-data-social-good-markets-good-blog), the [GivingGraph](http:\/\/casefoundation.org\/blog\/how-new-type-social-graph-could-change-philanthropy), and [MarketsForGood](http:\/\/marketsforgood.org) highlight early efforts to go further still by developing enabling infrastructure. While these tend to be informed with limited sectoral and\/or geo-politicial scope, they do hint at what might be possible if the ecosystem is able to coordinate at scale.\n\n**Going forward**  \n Going forward there appears an immediate need to link and deepen the conversations already happening around the globe. Over the coming weeks I\u2019ll begin by linking the people having those conversations and see what it might look like to keep bridging those converstaions into the future. If you know of other initiaves looking to do the same, I\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Digital technologies are increasingly integral to understanding and enabling social innovations.

As [we](http:\/\/igniter.com)\u2019ve been building Pine over the last six weeks, I\u2019ve answered it about 120 times. This is my experience.\n\nAt the beginning I\u2019d look at the question, not sure where to start. Often I\u2019d quickly tap in a few words. Sometimes those words turned into paragraphs. Sometimes I\u2019d check-in with a simple emoticon.\n\nAfter a while, I started noticing things throughout the day. Little thoughts. Sudden reactions. Sometimes I\u2019d reach for Pine and tap them in. Sometimes I\u2019d just pause and watch them play out. And then, it hit me. There was a pattern in my responses, a common theme lurking below the surface that had been shaping my days. Now it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve even done much to change that pattern yet, but simply noticing it lessened its\u00a0influence and my days are noticeably flowing a little more lightly. Not bad for a simple question.\n\nLooking back, Pine also helped set the stage in a few other ways.\n\nFirst it\u2019s private. These are my experiences, my thoughts, expressed in a way that\u2019s unfiltered and unedited. Not shared, they are raw and real.\n\nSecond, the simplicity. I can check in just about anywhere at any time, and I can do it in a few seconds whether I think I have anything to say or not.\n\nThird, while it\u2019s private, I\u2019m not alone. I can\u2019t see what my friends are saying, but I know that they are checking in. It\u2019s like we\u2019re walking [the Camino trail](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Camino_de_Santiago) together, silently nodding to each other as we discover a little more of ourselves with every step.\n\nIn summary, our lives are\u00a0made up of\u00a0the experiences we collect every day.

As <a href=\"http:\/\/igniter.com\">we<\/a>\u2019ve been building Pine over the last six weeks, I\u2019ve answered it about 120 times. This is my experience.<\/p>\n<p>At the beginning I\u2019d look at the question, not sure where to start. Often I\u2019d quickly tap in a few words. Sometimes those words turned into paragraphs. Sometimes I\u2019d check-in with a simple emoticon.<\/p>\n<p>After a while, I started noticing things throughout the day. Little thoughts. Sudden reactions. Sometimes I\u2019d reach for Pine and tap them in. Sometimes I\u2019d just pause and watch them play out. And then, it hit me. There was a pattern in my responses, a common theme lurking below the surface that had been shaping my days. Now it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve even done much to change that pattern yet, but simply noticing it lessened its\u00a0influence and my days are noticeably flowing a little more lightly. Not bad for a simple question.<\/p>\n<p>Looking back, Pine also helped set the stage in a few other ways.<\/p>\n<p>First it\u2019s private. These are my experiences, my thoughts, expressed in a way that\u2019s unfiltered and unedited. Not shared, they are raw and real.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the simplicity. I can check in just about anywhere at any time, and I can do it in a few seconds whether I think I have anything to say or not.<\/p>\n<p>Third, while it\u2019s private, I\u2019m not alone. I can\u2019t see what my friends are saying, but I know that they are checking in. It\u2019s like we\u2019re walking <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Camino_de_Santiago\">the Camino trail<\/a> together, silently nodding to each other as we discover a little more of ourselves with every step.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, our lives are\u00a0made up of\u00a0the experiences we collect every day.
