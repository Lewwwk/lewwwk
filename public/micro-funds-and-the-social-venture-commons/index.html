Working with the building blocks for a new kind of venture capital I&rsquo;ve been shaping a couple of core components &ndash; micro funds, and the social venture commons.
Micro-funds: making small, flexible, intuitive, low-cost, high-leverage investments. Features:

Short life: fully invested within 3 years or less
Small, high-leverage investments: invest financial (e.g. $25-50k) and social capital{.zem_slink rel=&ldquo;wikipedia&rdquo;} in high-leverage ways &ndash; core capacity, incremental engagement, financial seeding
Low or no fee: offset with performance based incentives for financial and impact returns appropriate to the fund
Light-weight and dynamic operations: led by individuals or organizations that have a unique position or perspective on the &lsquo;frontiers&rsquo; &ndash; run as a &lsquo;side-car&rsquo; to existing occupation
Commons interdependent: fund and individual investments must spark and support a conversation and generally contribute to and engage community to mitigate risk, improve success, and demonstrate returns
