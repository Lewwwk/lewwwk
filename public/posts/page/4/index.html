I don’t think there’s any need to replay the state of the world. It’s pretty clear we’re in a period of intense change, where the many systems of our society have reached their limits, where our civilization is set to pivot.
Back in 2001, Ervin Laszlo{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”} wrote about this in Macroshift. He found a common pattern in civilizations over the course of our history. They set out on a trajectory based on certain combination of technology and mindset. At some point, that trajectory becomes unsustainable and the civilizations reach, like any system, a bifurcation point{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”}. Either they breakthrough based on a new combo of technology and mindset or they breakdown. While breakdown is alarming, it’s been pretty common in the history of civilization. The only problem is, this is the first time our civilization has been global. Breakdown would really, really suck.

    <p>:::: entry-content Late last fall I had the opportunity to conduct an intensive review of the Vartana initiative on behalf of the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation. Vartana was an initiative to create a chartable bank in Canada dedicated to serving the voluntary sector. It held the promise of changing the availability of capital for the sector and as a Schedule I chartered bank, influencing the Canadian financial services industry. While ultimately felled by the financial services collapse of 2008, it holds some valuable lessons in entrepreneurial pursuit of systemic change.

lost and found: A Special Request.
I’ve been thinking a lot lately on how this happens. As an entrepreneur{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”} interested in a better future, sooner there are endless examples to point to. Grameen Bank{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Stonyfield Farms, Linux{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}, the Internet{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”}, the Web, Wikipedia{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}, and Craigslist{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} are all ones that come to mind for different reasons.
The one thing that seems universal in all these is passion, that unmistakable blend of purpose and persistence that drives things forward. It’s what brings that small group together to get something done, when no one really knows yet what they are doing or how it will happen.

    <p>:::: entry-content I was outed today with a healthy dose of snark:
This was not a case of “oh, sorry, Twitter{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} must have somehow unfollowed you”, it was a case of “ya, I unfollowed you… and everyone else.” You see, I’ve long valued Twitter a brilliant discovery tool – both for information and new relationships. Reading Power of Pull recently reminded me of that which got me to…
Well, this morning while waiting for a meeting I happened across a tweet that led me to a post which mentioned ManageFlitter (oh Twitter how you do that to me). I’ve tweaked my follow list a few times there before but this time when I got there, I decided to start entirely from scratch. Not because I’m bored with who I was following, but because I want to reset the power of Twitter to pull me in new directions. With a new venture underway it felt like the perfect time to do it.

Fear is the mortal enemy of creativity, innovation and happiness.
Too true.
As it prattled around in my head during my run this morning it struck me that fear is death. It’s an insatiable beast that tries to consume everything it encounters. It sucks energy out of us and pulls us back from progress. It makes us cower. In big ways and little ways. And each time we do a little bit of us or our relationships die.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content My recent adventures with my local utility offered up some great lessons on system failure, design, and purpose. I’ve jotted them down here as hunches to look back on rather than a epiphany of understanding.
Failure
Systemic failures can and will happen. They will happen often and their occurrence is an excellent opportunity to better understand your systems and the things that system is interacting with. Elimination of failure is impossible and probably unhealthy. Not learning from it is irresponsible and undoubtedly inefficient. Also, failure is subjective. What might look like massive failure to one participant in the system maybe be inconsequential to the rest of the system and vice versa.

This morning we received a notice on our front door that our gas had been disconnected. We were home at the time but the gas guy just hung the notice on the door AFTER turning the gas off. Stunned, I called UnionGas. They told me that I hadn’t paid in 6 months. Stunned again, I looked into my payment history and sure enough I hadn’t paid. I thought I was paying, and had absolutely no reason to believe I hadn’t been paying because, well, they GAVE ME NO NOTICE. Simple solution, pay up? Nope. Now that the gas has been disconnected, I will be without an essential utility for a minimum of 5 days.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>:::: entry-content I recently attended the Skoll World Forum{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} on Social Entrepreneurship. Going in I didn’t have much of an agenda but did end up with an experience that was worthwhile and possibly pivotal. The reason of course, as with all events it seems, is the people that gathered and connected.
From the content and conversation perspective, the highlight for me was the focus on systems as core to social entrepreneurship{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”}. Roger Martin{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”} tagged disrupting and establishing equilibria as the ultimate purpose, and previously tired conversations around metrics became flavoured with the emergent dynamics of working at the level of systems. While applying rigour to scale and diffuse innovation was a hot topic, people also recognized that the most innovative work often reflects insanity before it becomes recognized as brilliance. That this conversation was happening here was a good thing.
