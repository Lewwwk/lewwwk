    <p>::: entry-content I know a few people have been wondering about what going on silent retreat was like. To give it some flavour I decided to share my experience. But first, fair warning. If you are someone who doesn’t like ‘fluffy stuff’ you may not want to keep reading… but then again you may also then miss what I’ve found to be the most purely practical thing possible.
Since my youth I’ve been interested in existential questions like is this world just a dream? And if it’s a dream, is it my dream that everyone is a part of or am I part of someone else’s dream along with everything else? Over the years I had fun conversations with my friends, dipped into things like physics, philosophy, raiki, and buddhism but nothing seemed to stick. Then early in 2007 I was staying with a good friend and we got into this favourite conversation of mine with him and his partner. Over the next two evenings his partner asked me some deeply simple questions and shared some recordings from Adyashanti and a book by “Jed McKenna”. On my way home that next night I was reading the book when right in between two words something in me awoke.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content Pardon the profanity, but I’m tired of the bullshit.
People like to be right. Often being right means making other people wrong. This is not productive.
Saying that it is productive because you are engaging in debate… does not make it productive either.
All you are really doing is trying to win to be right. And who does that help? You. Who doesn’t it help? Everyone else.
If you want to be productive, contribute. Instead of being right, help the recipient of your righteousness try and explore their issue further. And if you find you’re not learning through the conversation then, again, stop trying to be right. If you can’t do that, shut up and do something else.

To have fun, live well, and make the world better by facilitating ambitious ventures.
Like last year, my focus rests on social technologies and how they are shifting our culture, disrupting and enabling the systems of our society, and changing the way in which we came together. ChangeMedium is the charitable expression of that, Shouldless is the commercial expression, and ProjectX is the ongoing work – re-inspired by the Vartana review – to develop tools and approaches to building those things.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content I was just writing an update to some great partners of mine and realized I needed to include a recap of 2009 for some context on what’s next. That of course reminded me that I’d yet to post one. So here goes.
Into the Wild 2009 was a pivotal one for me – a year of transition. It was full of new adventures and an unexpected closure of an old one. 2009 started with a bunch of excitement and energy around the Social Venture Commons, VenTwits, and Thread.io. A group of us had come together and were sweating out an experiment in peer-producing some apps that we thought could help people come together and build a better world by using public micro-messaging. We had some encouraging feedback on the concepts but we missed the mark and didn’t get enough traction (users or funding). We had felt we were constantly 2 weeks ahead of ’everyone else’ and when we took stock of what we felt we’d need to get to a viable venture, we just couldn’t do it with what we had. I had failed at guiding us through to a viable product and estimating what it would take to get us there.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>:::: entry-content It seems that every day I find myself wanting an iPad for something. Those moments are coming not from being on the computer, but from going about my daily life, and that’s what I think is what the iPad is about.
I started out thinking it would be ideal for my kids to use their favourite learning sites and with the attached keyboard as my mom’s next computer for the basic email and browsing that she really needs it for. But I’m also now finding a bunch of other uses, like browsing for movies to rent, watching those movies while travelling, reviewing our finances on Wesabe{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}, etc. Shawna also mentioned using it for recipes while cooking and I could see using it for logging DailyMile{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} runs as I stretch. I could even see it being the new tool for in-meeting presentations and napkin sketches.
