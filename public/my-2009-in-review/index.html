I was just writing an update to some great partners of mine and realized I needed to include a recap of 2009 for some context on what&rsquo;s next. That of course reminded me that I&rsquo;d yet to post one. So here goes.


Into the Wild

2009 was a pivotal one for me &ndash; a year of transition. It was full of new adventures and an unexpected closure of an old one. 2009 started with a bunch of excitement and energy around the Social Venture Commons, VenTwits, and Thread.io. A group of us had come together and were sweating out an experiment in peer-producing some apps that we thought could help people come together and build a better world by using public micro-messaging. We had some encouraging feedback on the concepts but we missed the mark and didn&rsquo;t get enough traction (users or funding). We had felt we were constantly 2 weeks ahead of &rsquo;everyone else&rsquo; and when we took stock of what we felt we&rsquo;d need to get to a viable venture, we just couldn&rsquo;t do it with what we had. I had failed at guiding us through to a viable product and estimating what it would take to get us there.">
