I’ve been following USV for a whlie now and actually interviewed Brad Burnham in preparation for a session at the Open Everything Retreat on Investing in Open. They seem to have a knack for investing in webtech ventures like Twitter{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} and Wesabe{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} that have models that can be deeply disruptive to the systems they are taking on and where the question of how they are going to make money from them is far from answered. And now they’re turning more of their attention to conventionally ‘social’ issues including education and the environment.

Off the cuff, I’ve been talking about building a ‘social capital{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”} supercharger’ over the past few months. It’s actually something that I’ve been working more deeply with Duncan Work (DW), Duncan Holmes and few others.
Well DW has launched a simple survey to start capturing some experiences around using LinkedIn{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} and Facebook{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} in organizations. Needless to say we’d be very interested in how you use them. If you’re up for taking 5 minutes – you can take the survey here.

Somehow though, in our society we have institutionalized birth and made it something impersonal. We are fortunate to have all the technology and knowledge we have that can helps us deal with things that go awry – but why is it that we start out treating pregnancy and birth as something that has ‘gone awry’.

Reflections at Hollyhock It’s been almost a week since the OpenEverything retreat and the reverberations continue. Heading into it, not having any roots in the open-source community, I was technically the biggest noob on the convening team. At the same time, what drew me into the meme and the event was a sense that something bigger was going on and that that something was rooted in a set of ideals and a drive for the practical that resonated with my core and my life experiences.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content So what does ‘open’ mean for ‘venturing’ and venturing on ’the frontiers’.
From some prior definitions, venturing is process of creating and evolving a venture, where a venture is an agreement among people to do things in service of a purpose and according to a set of values. More simply it’s about the process of organizing resources (social, financial, and human capital) toward realizing a certain intent.
If ‘open’ really is about a new mode of organization, then it is central to the process of venturing. It will inevitably impact every venture, the leadership and culture required, and the way in which we go about it.

It’s been in the works for awhile and I now think we’re really starting to make a connection between web tech (2.0&#43;), venture investing, social innovation. That connection is going to unleash some tremendous innovations and a surge in the activity directly working on the challenges facing our civilization. It feels like the emergence of a new domain that will take some very different approaches to change and influencing the course of civilization. It seems inspired by open source, technology innovation, financial risk taking, a venturing culture, and now a deepening and deeply felt realization that there are more important tasks to tend to.

    <p>::: entry-content
[Cross posted from my tumblog.] Open: “more radical innovations in ownership and production that change the basis on which markets currently work” In the conclusion of “Just Another Emperor” by Michael Edwards, he poses the above quote which I think is a great description of what ‘open’ is actually playing at. Full context here: “Philanthrocapitalism offers one way of increasing the social value of the market, but there are other routes that could offer equal or better results in changing the way the economic surplus is produced, distributed and used: the traditional route that uses external pressure, taxation and regulation; the philanthrocapitalist route that changes internal incentives and gives a little more back through foundations and corporate social repsonsibility; and the more radical innovations in ownership and production that change the basis in which markets work. We don’t know which of these routes carries the greatest long term potential, though all of them rely on civil society as a vehicle for innovation, accountability, influence and modified consumption, and especially for getting us from reformist to transformational solutions.” :::
