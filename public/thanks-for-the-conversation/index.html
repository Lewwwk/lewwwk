Yesterday, I had a great conversation with someone that a friend/colleague/client thought might be a worthwhile introduction. And he was right. The conversation was enjoyable and very helpful. Similar to the conversation a couple of weeks ago that had me step back from the full-blown financial model and pitch deck to trying to apply the venturing process I am suggesting to the creation of what I&rsquo;m building&hellip; this one prompted another launch path that fit with both my entrepreneurial drive to &lsquo;push&rsquo; something forward, and also with the process I&rsquo;m suggesting.">
