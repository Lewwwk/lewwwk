We believe Renewal2 is an interesting vehicle for mission related investing by foundations. No such trust is necessary in the U.S. as U.S. tax laws, unlike Canadian tax laws, do not prevent foundations from investing directly in LPs. We completed the trust documentation last week so now all of the legal structures are in place.” :::\n",
