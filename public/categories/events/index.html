    <p>:::: entry-content I recently attended the Skoll World Forum{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} on Social Entrepreneurship. Going in I didn’t have much of an agenda but did end up with an experience that was worthwhile and possibly pivotal. The reason of course, as with all events it seems, is the people that gathered and connected.
From the content and conversation perspective, the highlight for me was the focus on systems as core to social entrepreneurship{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”}. Roger Martin{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia”} tagged disrupting and establishing equilibria as the ultimate purpose, and previously tired conversations around metrics became flavoured with the emergent dynamics of working at the level of systems. While applying rigour to scale and diffuse innovation was a hot topic, people also recognized that the most innovative work often reflects insanity before it becomes recognized as brilliance. That this conversation was happening here was a good thing.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content I was just writing an update to some great partners of mine and realized I needed to include a recap of 2009 for some context on what’s next. That of course reminded me that I’d yet to post one. So here goes.
Into the Wild 2009 was a pivotal one for me – a year of transition. It was full of new adventures and an unexpected closure of an old one. 2009 started with a bunch of excitement and energy around the Social Venture Commons, VenTwits, and Thread.io. A group of us had come together and were sweating out an experiment in peer-producing some apps that we thought could help people come together and build a better world by using public micro-messaging. We had some encouraging feedback on the concepts but we missed the mark and didn’t get enough traction (users or funding). We had felt we were constantly 2 weeks ahead of ’everyone else’ and when we took stock of what we felt we’d need to get to a viable venture, we just couldn’t do it with what we had. I had failed at guiding us through to a viable product and estimating what it would take to get us there.

Our first research presenter was Hima Batavia, Research Assistant at the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health and Earth Institute at Columbia University. Her talk “Mobile Health: the Great Equalizer” focused on mobile health and showcased 7 examples including:

ChangeMedium Toronto is slated for October 24th at MaRS. What is it? Read more to find out. Want a hand in it? Leave a comment below.
What?
ChangeMedium is an initiative to provoke public micro-messaging as a medium for change. Public micro-messaging (e.g. Twitter{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}) is emerging as the most accessible, participatory public medium in history. Bringing the open and emergent properties of the web to the global reach of text messaging is already showing great potential for public benefit. But we’ve only begun to understand what’s happening let alone build an infrastructure to make the most of this medium. Enter ChangeMedium Toronto.

I&#39;m looking forward to this year&#39;s [Social Capital Markets conference](http://socialcapitalmarkets.net). [Last year](http://socialfinance.ca/blog/2008/12/opportunity-amidst-crisis-a-recap-of-social-capital-markets-conf/) I came way with a sense of a movement -- a long term movement that was working with the balance of social and financial objectives in service of a better world for all. I&#39;m sure this year will do much of the same -- bringing the best of the movement together to share their progress and inspire those who are looking to explore &#39;the intersection of money and meaning&#39;. If you are interested in this space, [it&#39;s the place to be](https://www.reg-services.com/socialcapitalmedia/socap09/). This year though, I’m going with a more ambitious agenda.
