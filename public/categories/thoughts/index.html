    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content Eric Henderson of Markets for Good recently asked me what was needed to build an information infrastructure for the social sector. Their vision is ambitious and important, and with the right approach it could transform how change happens. Here are my hunches about what’s required, and what we’re already doing to make it happen.
1. Focus on impact
It’s easy to get excited about data and information. They’re hot topics, and rightly so. As we wade into the digital revolution, we’re flooded with things demanding our attention. And the things we want others to see keep getting lost in the tsunami of everything else. But let’s step back for a second. Think of this like swimming across a river. The goal is to get across the river, not to go for a swim. What I need is a way to get across. And in the case of this infrastructure, what we need goes beyond data standards, quality, and accessibility to include supports that help us achieve impact more efficiently, and with greater efficacy.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content Humanity is in a chaotic phase, evolving from a civilization born of the industrial revolution to a civilization emerging from the digital revolution. As the pace of this evolution increases, so does our effort to direct it. That effort is called social innovation and it too is evolving.
From revolutions in music and media to the uprisings of the Arab Spring, Occupy movement and even Wikileaks, we can see a common pattern. Each is enabled by digital technology{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia noopener noreferrer” target=&#34;_blank&#34;} and the result of a complex social process comprised of many individual actions. Often they are user-driven, unfold rapidly, and challenge or circumvent a system that no-longer works they way its participants want. Ultimately, this is about people and the way they want the future to work, for them. It is the evolution of our civilization.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>:::: entry-content Digital technology is not about circuits and wires, it is about data and connectivity. In the Nature of Technology, W. Brain Arthur explains:
“Digitization allows functionalities to be combined even if they come from different domains, because once they enter the digital domain they become objects of the same type – data strings.”
Data also has another property. It is intangible. Where physical materials are limited by scarcity, data thrives in abundance, able to replicate freely without diminishing the original.

    <p>::: entry-content The industrial revolution{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia noopener noreferrer” target=&#34;_blank&#34;} began with technology that allowed us to manipulate our world in an entirely new way. As it developed it began to shape how we organize ourselves and even what we thought. Over time it shaped civilization as we know it. And now, as we reach the limits of that civilization it appears history is about to repeat.
In his 2001 book Macroshift, Ervin Laszlo{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia noopener noreferrer” target=&#34;_blank&#34;} observed that new civilizations begin with “technological innovations that destabilize the established structures and institutions of society.” In the last decade, we’ve seen digital technology{.zem_slink rel=“wikipedia noopener noreferrer” target=&#34;_blank&#34;} enable revolutions and uprisings around the world and trigger exisistential crises in the industries of music and media.

Sorry about the hangover.
It was a great party. Never thought it would end.
Left a couple bucks on the table. Hope that covers the booze.
Oh, and I think the freezer thawed and someone puked in the well. Might want to double-check before you cook up those last burgers or take a drink.
Also noticed there seems to be something wrong with the air conditioner. Think some of us were using it as an ashtray last night and it started making some weird sounds. Anyway, might want to take a look at that too. Heard it’s going to get hot today.

Art and engineering. Intuition and intelligence. Heart and mind. It’s at the intersections that our future manifests.
Lately in entrepreneurship, design, and social innovation there’s a definite leaning toward the rational side of this balance. A big part of that is the availability of measurable data. Because if we can measure, we can test. We can optimize. We can iterate. We can improve.

The future of organization has arrived. Like with sustainable coffee, cleantech, and the social trifecta (entrepreneurship/finance/innovation) before, I’ve noticed the shift in conversation from “no that will never happen/it must be stopped at all costs” to, “it’s happening or inevitable/how can I play”. It’s the shift from an avoidable future to an inevitable reality.
Historically for me, this is a time to shift fully from thinking to doing. And yet, I know it is the time when the opportunity for understanding really begins. So, as I sit here in the wee hours of the morning wondering why I am writing this post, I realize that I’m hoping for someone to hold the space for this thinking to shift to the next level to. While I’m not sure exactly what that is, Jean Russell seems to capture the direction in her post on integration.
