    <p>:::: entry-content I was outed today with a healthy dose of snark:
This was not a case of “oh, sorry, Twitter{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} must have somehow unfollowed you”, it was a case of “ya, I unfollowed you… and everyone else.” You see, I’ve long valued Twitter a brilliant discovery tool – both for information and new relationships. Reading Power of Pull recently reminded me of that which got me to…
Well, this morning while waiting for a meeting I happened across a tweet that led me to a post which mentioned ManageFlitter (oh Twitter how you do that to me). I’ve tweaked my follow list a few times there before but this time when I got there, I decided to start entirely from scratch. Not because I’m bored with who I was following, but because I want to reset the power of Twitter to pull me in new directions. With a new venture underway it felt like the perfect time to do it.

    <p>::: entry-content I happened across Alex Bogusky’s posterous yesterday and his sub-line stuck with me:
Fear is the mortal enemy of creativity, innovation and happiness.
Too true.
As it prattled around in my head during my run this morning it struck me that fear is death. It’s an insatiable beast that tries to consume everything it encounters. It sucks energy out of us and pulls us back from progress. It makes us cower. In big ways and little ways. And each time we do a little bit of us or our relationships die.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content My recent adventures with my local utility offered up some great lessons on system failure, design, and purpose. I’ve jotted them down here as hunches to look back on rather than a epiphany of understanding.
Failure
Systemic failures can and will happen. They will happen often and their occurrence is an excellent opportunity to better understand your systems and the things that system is interacting with. Elimination of failure is impossible and probably unhealthy. Not learning from it is irresponsible and undoubtedly inefficient. Also, failure is subjective. What might look like massive failure to one participant in the system maybe be inconsequential to the rest of the system and vice versa.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content This a story of how UnionGas disconnected my natural gas service WITHOUT NOTICE.
This morning we received a notice on our front door that our gas had been disconnected. We were home at the time but the gas guy just hung the notice on the door AFTER turning the gas off. Stunned, I called UnionGas. They told me that I hadn’t paid in 6 months. Stunned again, I looked into my payment history and sure enough I hadn’t paid. I thought I was paying, and had absolutely no reason to believe I hadn’t been paying because, well, they GAVE ME NO NOTICE. Simple solution, pay up? Nope. Now that the gas has been disconnected, I will be without an essential utility for a minimum of 5 days.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content I know a few people have been wondering about what going on silent retreat was like. To give it some flavour I decided to share my experience. But first, fair warning. If you are someone who doesn’t like ‘fluffy stuff’ you may not want to keep reading… but then again you may also then miss what I’ve found to be the most purely practical thing possible.
Since my youth I’ve been interested in existential questions like is this world just a dream? And if it’s a dream, is it my dream that everyone is a part of or am I part of someone else’s dream along with everything else? Over the years I had fun conversations with my friends, dipped into things like physics, philosophy, raiki, and buddhism but nothing seemed to stick. Then early in 2007 I was staying with a good friend and we got into this favourite conversation of mine with him and his partner. Over the next two evenings his partner asked me some deeply simple questions and shared some recordings from Adyashanti and a book by “Jed McKenna”. On my way home that next night I was reading the book when right in between two words something in me awoke.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content Pardon the profanity, but I’m tired of the bullshit.
People like to be right. Often being right means making other people wrong. This is not productive.
Saying that it is productive because you are engaging in debate… does not make it productive either.
All you are really doing is trying to win to be right. And who does that help? You. Who doesn’t it help? Everyone else.
If you want to be productive, contribute. Instead of being right, help the recipient of your righteousness try and explore their issue further. And if you find you’re not learning through the conversation then, again, stop trying to be right. If you can’t do that, shut up and do something else.

Somehow though I think it gets taken for granted. That couldn’t be more clear from the announcement that the leading organization that researches the topic is being forced to close. How is it that an organization like this cannot get more support?
Of course, people are making themselves heard on the interwebz. My partner Shawna started up a Facebook Group and the blogosphere and media are taking notice too.

    <p>::: entry-content I am privileged. Very privileged, and too often I lose sight of that and what it means.
As a healthy and able mid-thirties, white, upper-class, educated male, I am in a position where I don’t face discrimination in any way. I can go for a run in the park at night, breeze through airport security, meet someone for the first time and have the luxury of going about life undisturbed. And this is of course because everything I use and interact with is desinged with me in mind, usually by people very much like me. Physical things like chairs, cars, devices like my blackberry. Virtual things like websites, apps, content. Structural things like laws, regulations, customs and norms.
