To that, Ryan Coleman and I crafted this:
To have fun, live well, and make the world better by facilitating ambitious ventures.
Like last year, my focus rests on social technologies and how they are shifting our culture, disrupting and enabling the systems of our society, and changing the way in which we came together. ChangeMedium is the charitable expression of that, Shouldless is the commercial expression, and ProjectX is the ongoing work – re-inspired by the Vartana review – to develop tools and approaches to building those things.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content I was just writing an update to some great partners of mine and realized I needed to include a recap of 2009 for some context on what’s next. That of course reminded me that I’d yet to post one. So here goes.
Into the Wild 2009 was a pivotal one for me – a year of transition. It was full of new adventures and an unexpected closure of an old one. 2009 started with a bunch of excitement and energy around the Social Venture Commons, VenTwits, and Thread.io. A group of us had come together and were sweating out an experiment in peer-producing some apps that we thought could help people come together and build a better world by using public micro-messaging. We had some encouraging feedback on the concepts but we missed the mark and didn’t get enough traction (users or funding). We had felt we were constantly 2 weeks ahead of ’everyone else’ and when we took stock of what we felt we’d need to get to a viable venture, we just couldn’t do it with what we had. I had failed at guiding us through to a viable product and estimating what it would take to get us there.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>:::: entry-content It seems that every day I find myself wanting an iPad for something. Those moments are coming not from being on the computer, but from going about my daily life, and that’s what I think is what the iPad is about.
I started out thinking it would be ideal for my kids to use their favourite learning sites and with the attached keyboard as my mom’s next computer for the basic email and browsing that she really needs it for. But I’m also now finding a bunch of other uses, like browsing for movies to rent, watching those movies while travelling, reviewing our finances on Wesabe{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}, etc. Shawna also mentioned using it for recipes while cooking and I could see using it for logging DailyMile{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} runs as I stretch. I could even see it being the new tool for in-meeting presentations and napkin sketches.

December 18th was the first ever StatusCamp. It was also another ChangeMedium experiment – bringing the context of the medium of change to the developers building its future.
The event was an excellent day with over two dozen folks including the Status.net{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} team and Peter Deitz of SocialActions{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}. It was an amazing event to learn about where Status.net and the OpenMicroBlogging{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”} initiative (OMB) are going. The wiki has more details on OMB but it is due for a major new release and will be integrating PubSubHubBub, ActivityStrea.ms, Salmon, and WebFinger{.zem_slink rel=“homepage”}. What this means is an integration of emerging protocols to put people at the centre of micro-messaging. Not only is this a positive protocol development, but it signals the collaboration of major participants in this field to create an 0pen, interoperable system – an essential aspect of the medium of change.

    <p>::: entry-content Lemonade stands are an old symbol of enterprising youth – where the best ones were the ones that made the most money. Today’s kids are still enterprising but they’re doing for a different reason – to help others out.
I’ve recently seen it first hand as I was recruited by my munchkins to create a calendar of drawings from them and their friends together in support of Kids Saving the Rainforest. It’s great to see how quickly the kids came together to make this happen. They’re learning that joy of coming together and creating something for a greater purpose. They’re learning how to get others to help out. They’re simply excited to be ‘helping’.

We know complexity is rising and change is quickening. The systems of society are reaching their limits. Our interventions are having more impact. Repercussions ripple up, down, across systems.

Reason is not static. Reason evolves.

I’ve been getting some questions about how public micro-messaging is different than other social media. Why is it not just another tool?
While the flip answer of “well it’s public and micro and that’s the difference” is correct what is more elusive is how that is changing things – an inflection in the web – and society.

I&#39;m looking forward to this year&#39;s [Social Capital Markets conference](http://socialcapitalmarkets.net). [Last year](http://socialfinance.ca/blog/2008/12/opportunity-amidst-crisis-a-recap-of-social-capital-markets-conf/) I came way with a sense of a movement -- a long term movement that was working with the balance of social and financial objectives in service of a better world for all. I&#39;m sure this year will do much of the same -- bringing the best of the movement together to share their progress and inspire those who are looking to explore &#39;the intersection of money and meaning&#39;. If you are interested in this space, [it&#39;s the place to be](https://www.reg-services.com/socialcapitalmedia/socap09/). This year though, I’m going with a more ambitious agenda.
