    <p>::: entry-content The one other piece that I’ll share from my exploration into the Great Remix (see also), is a part about how I see doing happening differently as we move forward.
The following four areas now describe how doing is different in the context of the Great Remix.
[Employ Systems Dynamics]{style=“font-weight: bold;”}
[ (From conductor to mix master)]{style=“font-style: italic;”}
As the systems of our civilization demonstrate instability and failure more frequently, openings are created for previously unexpected initiatives to emerge. We can’t know when or how but rather must work to condition the emergence of those initiatives.

    <p>::: entry-content Part of my silence over the last few months has been from some deep-digging I was doing in an engagement with the Social Innovation group at MaRS and with the Centre for Social Innovation. One of the great things about the engagement was an opportunity to push deeper into what’s underneath social innovation, social entrepreneurship and social enterprise. What’s come from that is seeping into most everything I’m doing right now – and so it’s about time I get back to posting what I’ve been discovering.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content A brief twitter conversation with Tom at www.givemeaning.com on this subject had me feeling limited by the 140 character twitter limit… so here goes a quick mobile post.
I&#39;ve been conscious of the impact and role of consumption in our society for a while but www.storyofstuff.com and the movie Manufactured Landscapes from Mongrel Media have had me thinking a bit deeper lately.
I think &#39;giving&#39; has largely becoming another form of buying. Certainly giving has very little to do with need – unless ofcourse you turn to things like www.givemeaning.com :-). And the concept of enough is an abstract thing that is a personal, individual assessment of their own fulfillment of wants. And wants are fueled by cosumption. The more people shop and buy, the more they are exposed to things they could have and so are encouraged to have new wants. Green consumerism fits right into that. I&#39;m all for efficiency and recycling but those shouldn&#39;t encourage further consumption beyond replacement of what is no longer working.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content An interesting article about a new way of doing deals http://mobile2.wsj.com/beta2/htmlsite/html_article.php?id=1&amp;CALL_URL=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119889558568757053.html (thanks to Fred @ USV http://avc.blogs.com for the pointer).
What this article really seems to be dancing around is value of relationships in finding and doing deals and in venture success. What also comes is the conventional approach of being hands-off if you are going in early and also the power of being lean/lightweight in early-stage venturing. I&#39;m in the midst of doing a series of posts from my lastest conversations on the frontiers of venturing and this fits… and it&#39;s also a good reminder of how little really is changing on the frontiers.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content A little over a year-ago I began considering what’s next in my journey and exactly 3 months ago I initiated my first inquiry into what’s needed on the frontiers of venturing and venture investing. It hasn’t been a linear journey of course, with a good deal of my attention going towards getting Causeway going over the last year.
While that was ongoing, I had about a dozen conversations over November and December with some extraordinary social venture investors and funds in North America (including Renewal Partners, Social Capital Partners, Kellogg Foundation, RSF Social Finance, Good Capital and others). To all of you I am tremendously grateful for the generosity of your time, the candor with which you shared your experiences and the enthusiasm with which you’ve approached this exploration. Each conversation integrated into my own experiences and readings, and into every other conversation. What has emerged for me is a point of summary from which I feel ready to attempt some active experiments into how do we get better on the frontiers as venturers and venture investors.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content I’ve been thinking about what it is that really needs to be tracked in early-stage and transformative ventures. There certainly is the simple dynamic of financial viability and then there is the concept of productive, iterative exploration in the area of complex ambiguity I raised in an earlier post. I’ve been digging into what the measures are that actually help indicate the emergence of potential instability – before it’s actually happened. That’s the trick because learning that ap has exceeded cash &#43; ar at the next board meeting isn’t very helpful. And that’s not such a rare scenario – e.g. customer holding 80% or your ar is suddenly unable to pay.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>::: entry-content In my last post I intoduced ‘complex ambiguity’ as the stuff in venturing that entrepreneurs are really trying to figure out — where no-one ‘knows’ the answer. The deeper the change and the earlier the stage the greater the complexity and the ambiguity. My earlier tumbls about pentagram and that one designer have tweaked me that it’s akin to the creative process. Like designing a logo. Except that venturing can be a pereptual series of logos for something that itself is somewhat ambiguous and continuinally evolving. That’s complex ambiguity.

    <p>::: entry-content Continuing on my previous macroshift post, here are my reflections from the remainder of Ervin Laszlo’s book Macroshift{bluekey=&#34;&#34; bluelink=“yes”}.
For me the rest of the book was a lighter read with some simple observations relating to the mindset shift that is called for and clearly already underway. Here are a couple of framing quotes to set the stage:
“In the past, a more adapted civilization evolved over several generations; the rythym of change was relatively slow. This is no longer the case. The critical period for change today is compressed within the lifetime of a single generation.”
