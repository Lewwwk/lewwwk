It is important to note that these are a set of observations and interpretations that will continue to be evolved in practice. As such they represent a starting point for a concerted effort to ‘get better at venturing and investing on the frontiers’.\n[DEFINITIONS]{style=“font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;”}\n[Venture:]{style=“font-weight: bold;”} An agreement among people to do things in service of a purpose and according to a set of values.

These items become the core components of a [‘venture profile’]{style=“font-weight: bold;”} which is an articulation of the collective agreement on what the venture is.\n[]{style=“font-weight: bold;\"}Another interesting realization through these conversations and above definitions is that a venture, at it’s core, is an agreement. It starts with the first agreement between 2 or more people and grows with the deepening and addition of new relationships. Essentially a venture is ‘simply’ a bundle of relationships. Accordingly the individual relationships should also receive special attention through consideration and articulation of the essential process for evolution or termination of the agreement, and of each party’s:\nacknowledgment of the other party’s venture profile; their contribution; the manner of contribution; their compensation for their contribution; and any other explicit responsibilities and expectations. Collectively, the bundle of individual relationships along with each associated agreement form the essence of the collective agreement articulated in the venture profile and could be visualized through multidimensional maps which naturally will evolve as does the collection of individual relationships. Here there is a significant opportunity for new and improved practices in venturing. The collection of individual agreements also forms the basis for financial model. This is not the same as financial projections which are often an exercise in justifying an anticipated outcome but rather they are the basis for being meaningfully able to anticipate the results of the existing and anticipated agreements under certain conditions.\n[ACTION: A planning process]{style=“font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;”}\nWith the core profile in place we move into the activity of the venture itself which is best determined by those that have the authority to complete the action being determined. This follows from observations in systems science that planning only happens when action is the result and so can only be carried out by those with the authority to act. The most effective planning approaches will be recognized as [intentional]{style=“font-weight: bold;”}, [co-creative, and iterative action planning. ]{style=“font-weight: bold;”} Established approaches from community and software development could be well applied here. For example, the methodology from the Institute for Cultural Affairs Technology of Participation are particularly effective when conducted with short time horizons (e.g. monthly and/or quarterly) within the context of the venture profile which itself is reviewed periodically (e.g. annually with the inclusion of strategic direction planning). Similarly the agile development process is particularly relevant for venturing on the frontiers.\n[\n[GOVERNANCE: Cohesion and instability preemption]{style=“font-weight: bold;”}]{style=“font-size:130%;”}\nGovernance of a venture (collective agreement and the action that unfolds from it) is best fulfilled through attention on the cohesion of the venture and on signals of incipient instability. Going back to the definition of a venture, this is about monitoring the changing trends in relationship status and agreements. This is perhaps the most unique discovery in these conversations. Changes in the tone of relationships is often one of the biggest and most consistent indicators of [incipient instability]{style=“font-weight: bold;”}. This by no means implies that relationships should remain static or that relationships should not be allowed to decline, that’s simply a part of evolution. What it does imply is that changes in the trends of relationships status are particularly powerful indicators of change including growth and incipient instability. For example what’s often described as ‘momentum’ is an upward trend in the strengthening and addition of relationships. Or a founder of an organization challenging the direction the venture is taking may be an indicator of a change in the collective agreement, particularly if it was well articulated at the outset (which is rarely the case). Of course, monitoring financial metrics and changes in budget/plans can also signal incipient instability and by no means should be excluded. Rather disciplined attention should be focused on the metrics that indicate potential instability. If the management system is attentive to incipient instability it will be able to minimize its effects or avoid it all together. The other dynamic of effective governance is attention to the [cohesion]{style=“font-weight: bold;”} of the venture itself. This means that ensuring that both PIE and CV are being attended to and that the dynamic between them is constructive.\nThere are of course more detailed design aspects to organizing and operating a venture, several key ones of which are described in Heart of Enterprise, but from my experience, research, and through the recent conversations I believe venturing effectively on the frontiers requires the essence of:\nagreement and articulation of the venture (venture profile, relationship map, financial model); action through intentional co-creative, iterative action planning (process, budgets, time lines); and governance attentive to cohesion and able to anticipate and preempt incipient instability (future indicating metrics, report card, ability to respond constructively). Practically, there is significant opportunity in improving upon each of these areas and particularly in the area of relationships with the emergence of new ways and styles of connecting brought forth by virtual communications developments such as social networking technologies. And with that now begins the process of putting this into practice and an open invitation to those who want to embark on this with me.\nBlogged with Flock{rel=“noopener noreferrer” target=\"_new”} :::\n",

Coming out of this first inquiry I&rsquo;m left with new definitions for venture, venturing, and venturer and also a simplistic grouping that the process of venturing essentially requires agreement, action, and governance. It is important to note that these are a set of observations and interpretations that will continue to be evolved in practice. As such they represent a starting point for a concerted effort to &lsquo;get better at venturing and investing on the frontiers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>[DEFINITIONS]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;&rdquo;}</p>
<ul>
<li>[Venture:]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;&rdquo;} An agreement among people to do things in service of a purpose and according to a set of values.</li>
<li>[Venturing: ]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;&quot;}The process of creating and evolving a venture.</li>

</ul>
<p>[AGREEMENT: The venture profile]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;&rdquo;}<br>
In getting better at venturing on the frontiers, it becomes apparent that the first things required in a venture are an articulation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>purpose;</li>
<li>values; and</li>
<li>agreement,[ followed by [action]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;&rdquo;}. ]{style=&ldquo;font-style: italic;&rdquo;}</li>
</ul>
<p>This is particularly so in an effort to address complex ambiguity and so also must include the foundational foci that are effective amidst complex ambiguity, namely distinct, discreet attention on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lewwwk.com2007/12/venturing-on-frontier-requisite.html">core viability</a> ([CV]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;&rdquo;}); and</li>
<li><a href="http://lewwwk.com2007/12/venturing-on-frontier-requisite.html">the process of productive, iterative exploration</a> ([PIE]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;&rdquo;}).</li>
</ul>
<p>These items become the core components of a [&lsquo;venture profile&rsquo;]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;&rdquo;} which is an articulation of the collective agreement on what the venture is.</p>
<p>[]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold;&quot;}Another interesting realization through these conversations and above definitions is that a venture, at it&rsquo;s core, is an agreement. It starts with the first agreement between 2 or more people and grows with the deepening and addition of new relationships. Essentially a venture is &lsquo;simply&rsquo; a bundle of relationships. Accordingly the individual relationships should also receive special attention through consideration and articulation of the essential process for evolution or termination of the agreement, and of each party&rsquo;s:</p>
