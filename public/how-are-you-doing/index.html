It&rsquo;s a simple question and it&rsquo;s the heart of Pine&rsquo;s daily check-in. As we&rsquo;ve been building Pine over the last six weeks, I&rsquo;ve answered it about 120 times. This is my experience.
At the beginning I&rsquo;d look at the question, not sure where to start. Often I&rsquo;d quickly tap in a few words. Sometimes those words turned into paragraphs. Sometimes I&rsquo;d check-in with a simple emoticon.
After a while, I started noticing things throughout the day. Little thoughts. Sudden reactions. Sometimes I&rsquo;d reach for Pine and tap them in. Sometimes I&rsquo;d just pause and watch them play out. And then, it hit me. There was a pattern in my responses, a common theme lurking below the surface that had been shaping my days. Now it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve even done much to change that pattern yet, but simply noticing it lessened its influence and my days are noticeably flowing a little more lightly. Not bad for a simple question.">
