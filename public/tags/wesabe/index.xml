      <description>&lt;p&gt;::: entry-content
I&amp;rsquo;ve been actively trying different online services and tools lately, one of which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wesabe.com&#34;&gt;www.wesabe.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was a particularly interesting test for me as it deals with personal financial data (for most people one the most sensitive data streams) and I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long-time user of Microsoft Money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I found it interesting but it was an effort to use it. Well&amp;hellip; they just launched a firefox browser extension which makes my uploads even easier than they were with the version of Money I was using.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
