This a story of how UnionGas disconnected my natural gas service WITHOUT NOTICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning we received a notice on our front door that our gas had been disconnected. We were home at the time but the gas guy just hung the notice on the door AFTER turning the gas off. Stunned, I called UnionGas. They told me that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t paid in 6 months. Stunned again, I looked into my payment history and sure enough I hadn&amp;rsquo;t paid. I thought I was paying, and had absolutely no reason to believe I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been paying because, well, they GAVE ME NO NOTICE. Simple solution, pay up? Nope. Now that the gas has been disconnected, I will be without an essential utility for a minimum of 5 days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
