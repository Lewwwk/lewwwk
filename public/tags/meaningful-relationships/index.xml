I just saw two interesting perspectives on connecting with what people care about. One of which is from client/collaborator &lt;a href=&#34;www.communicopia.com&#34;&gt;Communicopia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLewkowitz/communicopia-iima-core-values-presentation&#34;&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt; and one is in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.canadianbusiness.com/entrepreneur/sales_marketing/article.jsp?content=20070228_103116_5132&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in Canadian Business titled &amp;ldquo;Sell More by Creating Desire&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme is something I&amp;rsquo;m seeing more and more everyday particularly with the steady growth in popularity of social and environmental justice issues. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a company giving to a charity, creating a new product, or simply your own efforts to make a difference the durability and success are anchored in authenticity &amp;mdash; is it connected with the true nature of who you are as an organization or an individual?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Following up on my conversation post earlier&amp;hellip; I just got off the phone with another connection by the same person. The &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; happened again. This time I consciously took my learning from the previous post into the call and it took the conversation even further. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s not really magic after all. My gratitude for the relationships I have just continues to grow. Thanks!
