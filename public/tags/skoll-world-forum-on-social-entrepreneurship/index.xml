      <description>&lt;p&gt;:::: entry-content
I recently attended the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skollworldforum.com&#34; title=&#34;Skoll World Forum&#34;&gt;Skoll World Forum&lt;/a&gt;{.zem_slink rel=&amp;ldquo;homepage&amp;rdquo;} on Social Entrepreneurship. Going in I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of an agenda but did end up with an experience that was worthwhile and possibly pivotal. The reason of course, as with all events it seems, is the people that gathered and connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the content and conversation perspective, the highlight for me was the focus on systems as core to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship&#34; title=&#34;Social entrepreneurship&#34;&gt;social entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;{.zem_slink rel=&amp;ldquo;wikipedia&amp;rdquo;}. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Martin&#34; title=&#34;Roger Martin&#34;&gt;Roger Martin&lt;/a&gt;{.zem_slink rel=&amp;ldquo;wikipedia&amp;rdquo;} tagged disrupting and establishing equilibria as the ultimate purpose, and previously tired conversations around metrics became flavoured with the emergent dynamics of working at the level of systems. While applying rigour to scale and diffuse innovation was a hot topic, people also recognized that the most innovative work often reflects insanity before it becomes recognized as brilliance. That this conversation was happening here was a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
