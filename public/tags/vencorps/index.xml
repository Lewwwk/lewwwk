      <description>&lt;p&gt;::: entry-content
Just saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://davidcrow.ca/article/1812/crowd-powered-capital&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; tipping me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cambrianhouse.com/vencorps/&#34;&gt;VenCorps&lt;/a&gt; which seems to be a venture fund using &amp;lsquo;crowd sourcing&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be interested to see how it goes and expect they will do well by essentially &amp;lsquo;amping up the network&amp;rsquo;. My guess is that they will be better at dealing with ambiguity (related to progressing along stage of development) in ventures but I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see if it will help them deal with complexity (related to depth of systemic change). The thing that gives me a sense that they won&amp;rsquo;t be as effective here is the military style they are coming out with. That to me indicates a very linear, command and control approach which is not effective in dealing with complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
