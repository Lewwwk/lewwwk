      <description>&lt;p&gt;::: entry-content
Have been meaning to post this for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I was on a train that &amp;lsquo;had an altercation&amp;rsquo; with a person who apparently had decided to part with the world. When the announcement came across the PA that there was a fatality and that we would be delayed at least 2 hours, there was a large outcry from many of the passengers in my car that went something like this: &amp;ldquo;Oh man&amp;hellip; now I&amp;rsquo;m going to be late. What an inconvenience. This sucks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
