Digital technology is not about circuits and wires, it is about data and connectivity. In the Nature of Technology, W. Brain Arthur explains:

&ldquo;Digitization allows functionalities to be combined even if they come from different domains, because once they enter the digital domain they become objects of the same type &ndash; data strings.&rdquo;

Data also has another property. It is intangible. Where physical materials are limited by scarcity, data thrives in abundance, able to replicate freely without diminishing the original.">
