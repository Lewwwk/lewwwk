December 18th was the first ever StatusCamp. It was also another ChangeMedium experiment &ndash; bringing the context of the medium of change to the developers building its future.
The event was an excellent day with over two dozen folks including the Status.net{.zem_slink rel=&ldquo;homepage&rdquo;} team and Peter Deitz of SocialActions{.zem_slink rel=&ldquo;homepage&rdquo;}. It was an amazing event to learn about where Status.net and the OpenMicroBlogging{.zem_slink rel=&ldquo;homepage&rdquo;} initiative (OMB) are going.  The wiki has more details on OMB but it is due for a major new release and will be integrating PubSubHubBub, ActivityStrea.ms, Salmon, and WebFinger{.zem_slink rel=&ldquo;homepage&rdquo;}.  What this means is an integration of emerging protocols to put people at the centre of micro-messaging. Not only is this a positive protocol development, but it signals the collaboration of major participants in this field to create an 0pen, interoperable system &ndash; an essential aspect of the medium of change.">
