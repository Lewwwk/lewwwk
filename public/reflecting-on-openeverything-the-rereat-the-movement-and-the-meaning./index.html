Reflections at Hollyhock

Heading into it, not having any roots in the open-source community, I was technically the biggest noob on the convening team.

What excites me is that at it’s core it’s also part of the movement of our society toward a more just a sustainable state – a movement that’s based on a common set of ideals that transcends meme, sector, or method.

A movement of people that recognize themselves as interdependent parts of everything from their project to their community to humanity etc.\nThis is what has me so interested and where I hope people rally – around the thing that is unifying – the thing that represents the change in course our society so desparately needs.
