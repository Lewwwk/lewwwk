I am privileged. Very privileged, and too often I lose sight of that and what it means.
As a healthy and able mid-thirties, white, upper-class, educated male, I am in a position where I don&rsquo;t face discrimination in any way. I can go for a run in the park at night, breeze through airport security, meet someone for the first time and have the luxury of going about life undisturbed. And this is of course because everything I use and interact with is desinged with me in mind, usually by people very much like me. Physical things like chairs, cars, devices like my blackberry. Virtual things like websites, apps, content. Structural things like laws, regulations, customs and norms.">
