For investment managers, it means insights into new products and investment opportunities. For governments and companies, it means earlier identification of climate-related vulnerabilities and better informed, long-term investment decisions. And for everyone else, it means a faster path toward a climate-compatible society.\nHarnessing climate intelligence to accelerate decarbonization and adaptation is an integral part of our Transition Economy narrative. Our research initiatives into the use of scenarios for systemic finance, or the effects of inter-systemic cascades all pointed us to the challenge of understanding and navigating the complex, systemic risks that are rippling across society. And so, today, we are excited to announce our investment in Climate X alongside Pale Blue Dot, a100x, Blue Wire, New Chic, and a global group of strategic angels.\nLukky, Kamil and their growing team have come to this with first-hand experience modelling and managing risk across asset portfolios, partnering with leading experts in climate science and artificial intelligence to arrive at this new approach.\nIf you are looking for better data on asset-level climate impacts, reach out to learn more about how Climate X can help. :::\n",
