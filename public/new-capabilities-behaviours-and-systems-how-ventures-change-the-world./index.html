A few weeks ago I started sharing how we think about the transformative potential of ventures, or in other words, what&rsquo;s the potential for a company to &lsquo;change the world&rsquo;.
While it&rsquo;s impossible to predict if any venture will actually &lsquo;change the world&rsquo;, we can be sure that if it does, it will have done so through some combination of the following:

introducing meaningful new capabilities;
sparking a change in behaviour;
enabling new systems of people, things, and information.

A few weeks ago I started sharing <a href="https://www.notion.so/possibilian/How-we-think-about-ventures-and-the-future-f248f1e4c7d44e15803c24b009648251">how we think about the transformative potential of ventures</a>, or in other words, what&rsquo;s the potential for a company to &lsquo;change the world&rsquo;.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s impossible to predict if any venture will actually &lsquo;change the world&rsquo;, we can be sure that if it does, it will have done so through some combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>introducing meaningful new capabilities;</li>
<li>sparking a change in behaviour;</li>
<li>enabling new systems of people, things, and information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at Twitter as a simple example.</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow people to post a simple text message that is publicly available (new capability)</li>
<li>People start publicly sharing seemingly trivial updates such as &lsquo;what they ate for breakfast&rsquo; (new behaviour)</li>
<li>Allow anyone to subscribe to someone&rsquo;s posts without their permission ( completes the loop to enable a new system)</li>
<li><em>&hellip; effort, investment, and good fortune &hellip;</em></li>
<li><strong>The world&rsquo;s information source for what&rsquo;s happening right now.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4 is what makes it happen, but steps 1, 2, and 3 set the stage for what&rsquo;s possible. While few had any reasonable belief that step 5 would be the outcome when it started, it would have been easy to see from the earliest days that a new capability (1) was leading to a new behaviour (2) and giving rise to a new system (3). The behaviour of &lsquo;sharing what you eat for breakfast&rsquo; was easy to dismiss, but enough of those that experienced it, sensed it could be something more.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see what how those components show up in early-stage ventures (click on the links for deeper dives):</p>
<p><strong>Sparking a change in behaviour:</strong></p>
