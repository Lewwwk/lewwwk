Expanding on my previous post on micro-funds and the social venture commons, here are few more pieces on what I see being the core elements of the Social Venture Commons.
First, I see the commons containing three interdependent realms:

conversations
connections
accomplishments

Accomplishments are the product and desired outcomes of every venture. They are also a great catalyst of conversation. Conversation, in turn, is a great catalyst of connections &ndash; connections to ideas, resources, people etc. And connections, in turn, catalyze accomplishments &ndash; new resources to help get things done better, faster, etc. Of course it&rsquo;s not that linear but I do sense a compelling interrelationship and even flow there.">

These include things like facilitating the creation of ‘forum groups’ – a central component of the Entrepreneur Commons and other networks like Enterpreneur’s Organization, Young President’s Organization, and World President’s Organization.
