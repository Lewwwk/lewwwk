Peer-production is driven by interest and passion &ndash; truly personal things, and in doing things in a peer-produced manner, financial and intellectual capital aren&rsquo;t as all-powerful.

In taking a peer-produced approach to building the Social Venture Commons and shldlss (the for-profit offshoot), I&rsquo;m seeing the power of individual contributions. Peer-production is driven by interest and passion &ndash; truly personal things, and in doing things in a peer-produced manner, financial and intellectual capital aren&rsquo;t as all-powerful. All this has me thinking about organizational partnerships differently and paying more attention to the fact that organizations generally have a lot of individuals working for them &ndash; the real resource that seems to make peer-production thrive.</p>
<p>So while specific agreements around financial and intellectual capital can still be extraordinarily valuable &ndash; I&rsquo;m interested right now in organizational partnerships that free their people to peer-produce, to some level, the things they are truly interested in and passionate about.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how this might look:<br>
&ndash; Partner identifies as a supporter of the Social Venture Commons (badge, blog, announcement etc.)<br>
&ndash; Partner allows for employees to take some of their time for peer-production (e.g. 30% of certain staff and/or 1 hour per week of all staff)<br>
&ndash; Partner frees employees to participate and benefit as individuals</p>
<p>What I think might happen:<br>
&ndash; Partner organizations get first hand experience in peer-production<br>
&ndash; Employees inspired by the opportunity to follow their interests and passions<br>
&ndash; People outside the Partner Organization start making meaningful contributions to the Partner</p>
<p>There are also countless &rsquo;negative&rsquo; things that might happen and I expect the results will come down to the spirit with which this is implemented. In my experience so-far the benefits far outweigh the risks. Regardless, the value of the experiment alone should be enough to have some innovative organizations give it a go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing who steps up to give this a try and seeing how it goes. It may seem there is a lot to lose, but I think we&rsquo;ll find we all have a lot more to give and that together we&rsquo;ll have a lot more to gain.
